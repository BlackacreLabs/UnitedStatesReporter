  <<Justice Thomas,>> with whom <<Justice Scalia>> joins, and with whom
<<Justice Alito>> joins in all but Parts I, II–C–1, and III–B–2,
dissenting.

  For the reasons set forth in <<Justice Scalia>>’s dissent, it is
clear that this Court lacks jurisdiction to entertain petitioner’s
claims, see \\ante,\\ at 655–669. The Court having concluded
otherwise, it is appropriate to respond to the Court’s resolution of
the merits of petitioner’s claims because its opinion openly flouts
our well-established duty to respect the Executive’s judgment in
matters of military operations and foreign affairs. The plurality’s
evident belief that \\it\\ is qualified to pass on the “military
necessity,” \\ante,\\ at 612, of the Commander in Chief’s decision
to employ a particular form of force against our enemies is so
antithetical to our constitutional structure that it simply cannot go
unanswered. I respectfully dissent.

# I

  Our review of petitioner’s claims arises in the context of the
President’s wartime exercise of his Commander in Chief authority
in conjunction with the complete support of Congress. Accordingly,
it is important to take measure of the @@679@@ respective roles the
Constitution assigns to the three branches of our Government in the
conduct of war.

  As I explained in \\Hamdi\\ v. \\Rumsfeld,\\ 542 U. S. 507 (2004),
the structural advantages attendant to the Executive Branch—namely,
the decisiveness, “ ‘activity, secrecy, and dispatch’ ”
that flow from the Executive’s “ ‘unity,’ ” \\id.,\\ at
581 (dissenting opinion) (quoting The Federalist No. 70, p. 472
(J. Cooke ed. 1961) (A. Hamilton))—led the Founders to conclude
that the “President ha[s] primary responsibility—along with the
necessary power—to protect the national security and to conduct the
Nation’s foreign relations.” 542 U. S., at 580. Consistent with this
conclusion, the Constitution vests in the President “[t]he executive
Power,” Art. II, § 1, provides that he “shall be Commander in
Chief” of the Armed Forces, § 2, and places in him the power to
recognize foreign governments, § 3. This Court has observed that these
provisions confer upon the President broad constitutional authority to
protect the Nation’s security in the manner he deems fit. See, \\e.
g., Prize Cases,\\ 2 Black 635, 668 (1863) (“If a war be made by
invasion of a foreign nation, the President is not only authorized but
bound to resist force by force . . . without waiting for any special
legislative authority”); \\Fleming\\ v. \\Page,\\ 9 How. 603, 615
(1850) (acknowledging that the President has the authority to “employ
[the Nation’s Armed Forces] in the manner he may deem most effectual
to harass and conquer and subdue the enemy”).

  Congress, to be sure, has a substantial and essential role in
both foreign affairs and national security. But “Congress cannot
anticipate and legislate with regard to every possible action the
President may find it necessary to take or every possible situation in
which he might act,” and “[s]uch failure of Congress . . . does
not, ‘especially . . . in the areas of foreign policy and national
security,’ imply ‘congressional disapproval’ of action taken by
the Executive.” \\Dames & Moore\\ v. \\Regan,\\ 453 U. S. 654, 678
(1981) (quoting \\Haig\\ v. \\Agee,\\ 453 U. S. 280, 291 (1981)).
Rather, in these domains, @@680@@ the fact that Congress has provided
the President with broad authorities does not imply—and the Judicial
Branch should not infer—that Congress intended to deprive him of
particular powers not specifically enumerated. See \\Dames & Moore,\\
453 U. S., at 678 (“[T]he enactment of legislation closely related to
the question of the President’s authority in a particular case which
evinces legislative intent to accord the President broad discretion
may be considered to invite measures on independent presidential
responsibility” (internal quotation marks omitted)).

  When “the President acts pursuant to an express or implied
authorization from Congress,” his actions are “ ‘supported by
the strongest of presumptions and the widest latitude of judicial
interpretation, and the burden of persuasion . . . rest[s] heavily upon
any who might attack it.’ ” \\Id.,\\ at 668 (quoting \\Youngstown
Sheet & Tube Co.\\ v. \\Sawyer,\\ 343 U. S. 579, 637 (1952) (Jackson,
J., concurring)). Accordingly, in the very context that we address
today, this Court has concluded that “the detention and trial of
petitioners—ordered by the President in the declared exercise of his
powers as Commander in Chief of the Army in time of war and of grave
public danger—are not to be set aside by the courts without the clear
conviction that they are in conflict with the Constitution or laws of
Congress constitutionally enacted.” \\Ex parte Quirin,\\ 317 U. S. 1,
25 (1942).

  Under this framework, the President’s decision to try Hamdan before
a military commission for his involvement with al Qaeda is entitled to
a heavy measure of deference. In the present conflict, Congress has
authorized the President “to use all necessary and appropriate force
against those nations, organizations, or persons \\he determines\\
planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that
occurred on September 11, 2001 . . . in order to prevent any future acts
of international terrorism against the United States by such nations,
organizations or persons.” Authorization for Use of Military Force
(AUMF), 115 Stat. @@681@@ 224, note following 50 U. S. C. § 1541
(2000 ed., Supp. III) (emphasis added). As a plurality of the Court
observed in \\Hamdi,\\ the “capture, detention, and \\trial\\ of
unlawful combatants, by ‘universal agreement and practice,’ are
‘important incident[s] of war,’ ” 542 U. S., at 518 (quoting
\\Quirin, supra,\\ at 28, 30; emphasis added), and are therefore “an
exercise of the ‘necessary and appropriate force’ Congress has
authorized the President to use,” \\Hamdi,\\ 542 U. S., at 518;
\\id.,\\ at 587 (<<Thomas,>> J., dissenting). \\Hamdi\\’s observation
that military commissions are included within the AUMF’s authorization
is supported by this Court’s previous recognition that “[a]n
important incident to the conduct of war is the adoption of measures by
the military commander, not only to repel and defeat the enemy, but to
seize and subject to disciplinary measures those enemies who, in their
attempt to thwart or impede our military effort, have violated the
law of war.” \\In re Yamashita,\\ 327 U. S. 1, 11 (1946); see also
\\Quirin, supra,\\ at 28–29; \\Madsen\\ v. \\Kinsella,\\ 343 U. S.
341, 354, n. 20 (1952) (“ ‘[T]he military commission . . . is an
institution of the greatest importance in a period of war and should
be preserved’ ” (quoting S. Rep. No. 229, 63d Cong., 2d Sess., 53
(1914) (testimony of Gen. Crowder))).

  Although the Court concedes the legitimacy of the President’s use
of military commissions in certain circumstances, \\ante,\\ at 594, it
suggests that the AUMF has no bearing on the scope of the President’s
power to utilize military commissions in the present conflict, \\ibid.\\
Instead, the Court determines the scope of this power based exclusively
on Article 21 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), 10
U. S. C. § 821, the successor to Article 15 of the Articles of
War, which \\Quirin\\ held “authorized trial of offenses against the
law of war before [military] commissions.” 317 U. S., at 29. As I
shall discuss below, Article 21 alone supports the use of commissions
here. Nothing in the language of Article 21, however, suggests that it
outlines the entire reach of congressional authorization of military
commissions in all @@682@@ conflicts—quite the contrary, the language
of Article 21 presupposes the existence of military commissions
under an independent basis of authorization.[[1]] Indeed, consistent
with \\Hamdi\\’s conclusion that the AUMF itself authorizes the
trial of unlawful combatants, the original sanction for military
commissions historically derived from congressional authorization
of “the initiation of war” with its attendant authorization of
“the employment of all necessary and proper agencies for its due
prosecution.” W. Winthrop, Military Law and Precedents 831 (rev.
2d ed. 1920) (hereinafter Winthrop) (emphasis deleted). Accordingly,
congressional authorization for military commissions pertaining to the
instant conflict derives not only from Article 21 of the UCMJ, but
also from the more recent, and broader, authorization contained in the
AUMF.[[2]]

  I note the Court’s error respecting the AUMF not because it is
necessary to my resolution of this case—Hamdan’s military commission
can plainly be sustained solely under Article 21—but to emphasize
the complete congressional sanction of the President’s exercise
of his Commander in Chief authority to conduct the present war. In
such circumstances, as previously noted, our duty to defer to the
Executive’s military and foreign policy judgment is at its zenith;
it does not coun@@683@@tenance the kind of second-guessing the Court
repeatedly engages in today. Military and foreign policy judgments

^1 As previously noted, Article 15 of the Articles of War was the
predecessor of Article 21 of the UCMJ. Article 21 provides as follows:
“The provisions of this chapter conferring jurisdiction upon
courts-martial do not deprive military commissions, provost courts, or
other military tribunals of concurrent jurisdiction with respect to
offenders or offenses that by statute or by the law of war may be tried
by military commissions, provost courts, or other military tribunals.”
10 U. S. C. § 821.

^2 Although the President very well may have inherent authority to try
unlawful combatants for violations of the law of war before military
commissions, we need not decide that question because Congress has
authorized the President to do so. Cf. \\Hamdi\\ v. \\Rumsfeld,\\ 542
U. S. 507, 587 (2004) (<<Thomas,>> J., dissenting) (same conclusion
respecting detention of unlawful combatants).

    “ ‘are and should be undertaken only by those directly
responsible to the people whose welfare they advance or imperil. They
are decisions of a kind for which the Judiciary has neither aptitude,
facilities nor responsibility and which has long been held to belong
in the domain of political power not subject to judicial intrusion
or inquiry.’ ” \\Hamdi, supra,\\ at 582–583 (<<Thomas,>> J.,
dissenting) (quoting \\Chicago & Southern Air Lines, Inc.\\ v.
\\Waterman S. S. Corp.,\\ 333 U. S. 103, 111 (1948)).

It is within this framework that the lawfulness of Hamdan’s commission
should be examined.

# II

  The plurality accurately describes some aspects of the history of
military commissions and the prerequisites for their use. Thus, I do
not dispute that military commissions have historically been “used
in three [different] situations,” \\ante,\\ at 595, and that the
only situation relevant to the instant case is the use of military
commissions “ ‘to seize and subject to disciplinary measures those
enemies who. . . have violated the law of war,’ ” \\ante,\\ at 596
(quoting \\Quirin, supra,\\ at 28–29). Similarly, I agree with the
plurality that Winthrop’s treatise sets forth the four relevant
considerations for determining the scope of a military commission’s
jurisdiction, considerations relating to the (1) time and (2) place of
the offense, (3) the status of the offender, and (4) the nature of the
offense charged. Winthrop 836–840. The Executive has easily satisfied
these considerations here. The plurality’s contrary conclusion rests
upon an incomplete accounting and an unfaithful application of those
considerations.

## A

  The first two considerations are that a law-of-war military commission
may only assume jurisdiction of “offences com@@684@@mitted within
the field of the command of the convening commander,” and that such
offenses “must have been committed within the period of the war.”
See \\id.,\\ at 836, 837; \\ante,\\ at 597. Here, as evidenced by
Hamdan’s charging document, the Executive has determined that the
theater of the present conflict includes “Afghanistan, Pakistan and
other countries” where al Qaeda has established training camps, App.
to Pet. for Cert. 64a, and that the duration of that conflict dates
back (at least) to Usama bin Laden’s August 1996 Declaration of Jihad
Against the Americans, \\ibid.\\ Under the Executive’s description of
the conflict, then, every aspect of the charge, which alleges overt acts
in “Afghanistan, Pakistan, Yemen and other countries” taking place
from 1996 to 2001, satisfies the temporal and geographic prerequisites
for the exercise of law-of-war military commission jurisdiction.
\\Id.,\\ at 65a–67a. And these judgments pertaining to the scope of
the theater and duration of the present conflict are committed solely
to the President in the exercise of his Commander in Chief authority.
See \\Prize Cases,\\ 2 Black, at 670 (concluding that the President’s
Commander in Chief judgment about the nature of a particular conflict
was “a question to be decided \\by him,\\ and this Court must be
governed by the decisions and acts of the political department of the
Government to which this power was entrusted”).

  Nevertheless, the plurality concludes that the legality of the charge
  against Hamdan is doubtful because “Hamdan is charged not with an
  overt act for which he was caught red-handed in a theater of war .
  . . but with an \\agreement\\ the inception of which long predated
  . . . the [relevant armed conflict].” \\Ante,\\ at 612 (emphasis
  in original). The plurality’s willingness to second-guess the
  Executive’s judgments in this context, based upon little more than
  its unsupported assertions, constitutes an unprecedented departure
  from the traditionally limited role of the courts with respect to war
  and an unwarranted intrusion on executive authority. And @@685@@ even
  if such second-guessing were appropriate, the plurality’s attempt to
  do so is unpersuasive.

  As an initial matter, the plurality relies upon the date of the
AUMF’s enactment to determine the beginning point for the “period of
the war,” Winthrop 836–837, thereby suggesting that petitioner’s
commission does not have jurisdiction to try him for offenses committed
prior to the AUMF’s enactment. \\Ante,\\ at 598–600, 612. But
this suggestion betrays the plurality’s unfamiliarity with the
realities of warfare and its willful blindness to our precedents. The
starting point of the present conflict (or indeed any conflict) is not
determined by congressional enactment, but rather by the initiation
of hostilities. See \\Prize Cases, supra,\\ at 668 (recognizing that
war may be initiated by “invasion of a foreign nation,” and that
such initiation, and the President’s response, usually \\precedes\\
congressional action). Thus, Congress’ enactment of the AUMF did
not mark the beginning of this Nation’s conflict with al Qaeda, but
instead authorized the President to use force in the midst of an ongoing
conflict. Moreover, while the President’s “war powers” may not
have been activated until the AUMF was passed, \\ante,\\ at 599, n. 31
(emphasis deleted), the date of such activation has never been used to
determine the scope of a military commission’s jurisdiction.[[3]]
Instead, the traditional rule is that “[o]f@@686@@fenses committed
before a formal declaration of war or before the declaration of martial
law may be tried by military commission.” Green, The Military
Commission, 42 Am. J. Int’l L. 832, 848 (1948) (hereinafter Green);
see also C. Howland, Digest of Opinions of the Judge-Advocates General
of the Army 1067 (1912) (hereinafter Howland) (“A military commission
. . . exercising . . . jurisdiction . . . under the laws of war . . .
may take cognizance of offenses committed, during the war, \\before\\
the initiation of the military government or martial law” (emphasis
in original));[[4]] cf. \\Yamashita,\\ 327 U. S., at 13 (“The extent
to which the power to prosecute violations of the law of war shall be
exercised before peace is declared rests, not with the courts, but
with the political branch of the Government”). Consistent with this
principle, on facts virtually identical to those here, a military
commission tried Julius Otto Kuehn for conspiring with Japanese
officials to betray the United States Fleet to the Imperial Japanese
Government prior to its attack on Pearl Harbor. Green 848.[[5]] @@687@@

^3 Even if the formal declaration of war were generally the
determinative act in ascertaining the temporal reach of the jurisdiction
of a military commission, the AUMF itself is inconsistent with the
plurality’s suggestion that such a rule is appropriate in this case.
See \\ante,\\ at 598–600, 612. The text of the AUMF is backward
looking, authorizing the use of “all necessary and appropriate force
against those nations, organizations, or persons he determines planned,
authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on
September 11, 2001.” § 2(a), 115 Stat. 224. Thus, the President’s
decision to try Hamdan by military commission—a use of force
authorized by the AUMF—for Hamdan’s involvement with al Qaeda prior
to September 11, 2001, fits comfortably within the framework of the
AUMF. In fact, bringing the September 11 conspira@@686@@tors to justice
is the \\primary point\\ of the AUMF. By contrast, on the plurality’s
logic, the AUMF would not grant the President the authority to try Usama
bin Laden himself for his involvement in the events of September 11,
2001.

^4 The plurality suggests these authorities are inapplicable because
nothing in its “analysis turns on the admitted absence of either a
formal declaration of war or a declaration of martial law. Our focus
instead is on the . . . AUMF.” \\Ante,\\ at 599, n. 31. The difference
identified by the plurality is purely semantic. Both Green and Howland
confirm that the date of the enactment that establishes a legal basis
for forming military commissions—whether it be a declaration of war,
a declaration of martial law, \\or\\ an authorization to use military
force—does not limit the jurisdiction of military commissions to
offenses committed after that date.

^5 The plurality attempts to evade the import of this historical example
by observing that Kuehn was tried before a martial law commission for a
violation of federal espionage statutes. \\Ibid.\\ As an initial matter,
the fact that Kuehn was tried before a martial law commission for an
offense committed prior to the establishment of martial law provides
strong support for the President’s contention that he may try Hamdan
for offenses @@687@@ committed prior to the enactment of the AUMF. Here
the AUMF serves the same function as the declaration of martial law in
Hawaii in 1941, establishing legal authority for the constitution of
military commissions. Moreover, Kuehn was not tried and punished “by
statute, but by the laws and usages of war.” \\United States\\ v.
\\Kuehn,\\ Board of Review 6 (Office of the Military Governor, Hawaii
1942). Indeed, in upholding the imposition of the death penalty, a
sentence “not authorized by the Espionage statutes,” \\id.,\\ at
5, Kuehn’s Board of Review explained that “[t]he fact that persons
may be tried and punished . . . by a military commission for committing
acts defined as offenses by. . . federal statutes does not mean that
such persons are being tried for violations of such. . . statutes; they
are, instead, being tried for acts made offenses only by orders of
the . . . commanding general,” \\id.,\\ at 6. Lastly, the import of
this example is not undermined by \\Duncan\\ v. \\Kahanamoku,\\ 327
U. S. 304 (1946). The question before the Court in that case involved
only whether “loyal civilians in loyal territory should have their
daily conduct governed by military orders,” \\id.,\\ at 319; it did
“not involve the well-established power of the military to exercise
jurisdiction over . . . enemy belligerents,” \\id.,\\ at 313.

  Moreover, the President’s determination that the present conflict
dates at least to 1996 is supported by overwhelming evidence. According
to the State Department, al Qaeda \\declared war\\ on the United
States as early as August 1996. See Dept. of State Fact Sheet: Usama
bin Ladin (Aug. 21, 1998); Dept. of State Fact Sheet: The Charges
against International Terrorist Usama Bin Laden (Dec. 20, 2000); cf.
\\Prize Cases,\\ 2 Black, at 668 (recognizing that a state of war
exists even if “the declaration of it be \\unilateral\\” (emphasis
in original)). In February 1998, al Qaeda leadership issued another
statement ordering the indiscriminate—and, even under the laws of
war as applied to legitimate nation-states, plainly illegal—killing
of American civilians and military personnel alike. See Jihad Against
Jews and Crusaders: World Islamic Front Statement 2 (Feb. 23, 1998), in
Y. Alexander & M. Swetnam, Usama bin Laden’s al-Qaida: Profile of a
Terrorist Network, App. 1B (2001) (“The ruling to kill the Americans
and their allies—civilians and military—is an individual duty for
every Muslim who can do it in any country in which it is possible to do
it”). This was @@688@@ not mere rhetoric; even before September 11,
2001, al Qaeda was involved in the bombing of the World Trade Center in
New York City in 1993, the bombing of the Khobar Towers in Saudi Arabia
in 1996, the bombing of the U. S. Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania
in 1998, and the attack on the U. S. S. \\Cole\\ in Yemen in 2000.
See \\id.,\\ at 1. In response to these incidents, the United States
“attack[ed] facilities belonging to Usama bin Ladin’s network”
as early as 1998. Dept. of State Fact Sheet: Usama bin Ladin (Aug. 21,
1998). Based on the foregoing, the President’s judgment—that the
present conflict substantially predates the AUMF, extending at least
as far back as al Qaeda’s 1996 declaration of war on our Nation, and
that the theater of war extends at least as far as the localities of al
Qaeda’s principal bases of operations—is beyond judicial reproach.
And the plurality’s unsupportable contrary determination merely
confirms that “‘the Judiciary has neither aptitude, facilities nor
responsibility’ ” for making military or foreign affairs judgments.
\\Hamdi,\\ 542 U. S., at 585 (<<Thomas,>> J., dissenting) (quoting
\\Chicago & Southern Air Lines,\\ 333 U. S., at 111).

## B

  The third consideration identified by Winthrop’s treatise for
the exercise of military commission jurisdiction pertains to the
persons triable before such a commission, see \\ante,\\ at 597–598;
Winthrop 838. Law-of-war military commissions have jurisdiction over
“ ‘[i]ndividuals of the enemy’s army who have been guilty of
illegitimate warfare or other offences in violation of the laws of
war,’ ” \\ante,\\ at 598 (quoting Winthrop 838). They also have
jurisdiction over “[i]rregular armed bodies or persons not forming
part of the organized forces of a belligerent” “who would not be
likely to respect the laws of war.” \\Id.,\\ at 783, 784. Indeed,
according to Winthrop, such persons are not “within the protection
of the laws of war” and were “liable to be shot, imprisoned, or
banished, either summarily where their guilt was clear or @@689@@
upon trial and conviction by military commission.” \\Id.,\\ at 784.
This consideration is easily satisfied here, as Hamdan is an unlawful
combatant charged with joining and conspiring with a terrorist network
dedicated to flouting the laws of war. 344 F. Supp. 2d 152, 161 (DC
2004); App. to Pet. for Cert. 63a–67a.

## C

  The fourth consideration relevant to the jurisdiction of law-of-war
military commissions relates to the nature of the offense charged.
As relevant here, such commissions have jurisdiction to try “
‘[v]iolations of the laws and usages of war cognizable by military
tribunals only,’ ” \\ante,\\ at 598 (quoting Winthrop 839). In
contrast to the preceding considerations, this Court’s precedents
establish that judicial review of “whether any of the acts charged
is an offense against the law of war cognizable before a military
tribunal” is appropriate. \\Quirin,\\ 317 U. S., at 29. However,
“charges of violations of the law of war triable before a military
tribunal need not be stated with the precision of a common law
indictment.” \\Yamashita,\\ 327 U. S., at 17. And whether an offense
is a violation of the law of war cognizable before a military commission
must be determined pursuant to “the system of common law applied by
military tribunals.” \\Quirin, supra,\\ at 30; \\Yamashita, supra,\\
at 8.

  The common law of war as it pertains to offenses triable by military
commission is derived from the “experience of our wars” and our
wartime tribunals, Winthrop 839, and “the laws and usages of war as
understood and practiced by the civilized nations of the world,”
11 Op. Atty. Gen. 297, 310 (1865). Moreover, the common law of war
is marked by two important features. First, as with the common law
generally, it is flexible and evolutionary in nature, building upon
the experience of the past and taking account of the exigencies of the
present. Thus, “[t]he law of war, like every other code of laws,
declares what shall not be done, and does not say what may be done.
The legitimate use of the great @@690@@ power of war, or rather the
prohibitions upon the use of that power, increase or diminish as the
necessity of the case demands.” \\Id.,\\ at 300. Accordingly, this
Court has recognized that the “jurisdiction” of “our common-law
war courts” has not been “prescribed by statute,” but rather
“has been adapted in each instance to the need that called it
forth.” \\Madsen,\\ 343 U. S., at 346–348. Second, the common
law of war affords a measure of respect for the judgment of military
commanders. Thus, “[t]he commander of an army in time of war has the
same power to organize military tribunals and execute their judgments
that he has to set his squadrons in the field and fight battles. His
authority in each case is from the law and usage of war.” 11 Op.
Atty. Gen., at 305. In recognition of these principles, Congress has
generally “ ‘left it to the President, and the military commanders
representing him, to employ the commission, \\as occasion may require,\\
for the investigation and punishment of violations of the laws of
war.’ ” \\Madsen, supra,\\ at 347, n. 9 (quoting Winthrop 831;
emphasis added).

  In one key respect, the plurality departs from the proper framework
for evaluating the adequacy of the charge against Hamdan under the
laws of war. The plurality holds that where, as here, “neither the
elements of the offense nor the range of permissible punishments is
defined by statute or treaty, the precedent [establishing whether
an offense is triable by military commission] must be plain and
unambiguous.” \\Ante,\\ at 602. This is a pure contrivance, and a
bad one at that. It is contrary to the presumption we acknowledged
in \\Quirin,\\ namely, that the actions of military commissions are
“not to be set aside by the courts without the \\clear conviction\\
that they are” unlawful, 317 U. S., at 25 (emphasis added). It is
also contrary to \\Yamashita,\\ which recognized the legitimacy of
that military commission notwithstanding a substantial disagreement
pertaining to whether Yamashita had been charged with a violation of
the law of war. Compare 327 U. S., at 17 (noting that the allegations
were “ade@@691@@quat[e]” and “need not be stated with . . .
precision”), with \\id.,\\ at 35 (Murphy, J., dissenting) (arguing
that the charge was inadequate). Nor does it find support from the
separation-of-powers authority cited by the plurality. Indeed,
Madison’s praise of the separation of powers in The Federalist No.
47, quoted \\ante,\\ at 602, if it has any relevance at all, merely
highlights the illegitimacy of today’s judicial intrusion onto core
executive prerogatives in the waging of war, where executive competence
is at its zenith and judicial competence at its nadir.

  The plurality’s newly minted clear-statement rule is also
fundamentally inconsistent with the nature of the common law which, by
definition, evolves and develops over time and does not, in all cases,
“say what may be done.” 11 Op. Atty. Gen., at 300. Similarly, it is
inconsistent with the nature of warfare, which also evolves and changes
over time, and for which a flexible, evolutionary common-law system
is uniquely appropriate.[[6]] Though the charge against Hamdan easily
satisfies even the plurality’s manufactured rule, see \\infra,\\
at 692–706, the plurality’s inflexible approach has dangerous
implications for the Executive’s ability to discharge his duties as
Commander in Chief in future cases. We should undertake to determine
whether an unlawful combatant has been charged with an offense against
the law of war with an understanding that the common law of war is
flexible, responsive to the exigencies of the present conflict, and
deferential to the judgment of military commanders. @@692@@

^6 Indeed, respecting the present conflict, the President has found that
“the war against terrorism ushers in a new paradigm, one in which
groups with broad, international reach commit horrific acts against
innocent civilians, sometimes with the direct support of states. Our
Nation recognizes that this new paradigm—ushered in not by us, but by
terrorists—requires new thinking in the law of war.” App. 34–35.
Under the Court’s approach, the President’s ability to address this
“new paradigm” of inflicting death and mayhem would be completely
frozen by rules developed in the context of conventional warfare.

### 1

  Under either the correct, flexible approach to evaluating the adequacy
of Hamdan’s charge, or under the plurality’s new, clear-statement
approach, Hamdan has been charged with conduct constituting two distinct
violations of the law of war cognizable before a military commission:
membership in a war-criminal enterprise and conspiracy to commit war
crimes. The charging section of the indictment alleges both that Hamdan

^7 It is true that both of these separate offenses are charged under a
single heading entitled “CHARGE: CONSPIRACY,” App. to Pet. for Cert.
65a. But that does not mean that they must be treated as a single crime,
when the law of war treats them as separate crimes. As we acknowledged
in \\In re Yamashita,\\ 327 U. S. 1 (1946), “charges of violations
of the law of war triable before a military tribunal need not be stated
with the precision of a common law indictment.” \\Id.,\\ at 17; cf. W.
Birkhimer, Military Government and Martial Law 536 (3d rev. ed. 1914)
(hereinafter Birkhimer) (“[I]t would be extremely absurd to expect the
same precision in a charge brought before a court-martial as is required
to support a conviction before a justice of the peace” (internal
quotation marks omitted)).

  ^ Nevertheless, the plurality contends that Hamdan was “not actually
charged,” \\ante,\\ at 601, n. 32 (emphasis deleted), with being a
member in a war-criminal organization. But that position is demonstrably
wrong. Hamdan’s charging document expressly \\charges\\ that he
“willfully and knowingly joined an enterprise of persons who shared a
common criminal purpose.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 65a. Moreover, the
plurality’s contention that we may only look to the label affixed to
the charge to determine if the charging document alleges an offense
triable by military commission is flatly inconsistent with its treatment
of the Civil War cases—where it accepts as valid charges that did not
appear in the heading or title of the charging document, or even the
listed charge itself, but only in the supporting specification. See,
\\e. g., ante,\\ at 609 (discussing the military commission trial of
Wirz). For example, in the Wirz case, Wirz was charged @@693@@ with
conspiring to violate the laws of war, and that charge was supported
with allegations that he personally committed a number of atrocities.
The plurality concludes that military commission jurisdiction was
appropriate in that case not based upon the charge of conspiracy,
but rather based upon the allegations of various atrocities in the
specification which were \\not\\ separately charged. \\Ante,\\ at 609.
Just as these atrocities, not separately charged, were independent
violations of the law of war supporting Wirz’s trial by military
commission, so too here Hamdan’s membership in al Qaeda and his
provision of various forms of assistance to al Qaeda’s top leadership
are independent violations of the law of war supporting his trial by
military commission.

  The common law of war establishes that Hamdan’s willful and knowing
membership in al Qaeda is a war crime chargeable before a military
commission. Hamdan, a confirmed enemy combatant and member or affiliate
of al Qaeda, has been charged with willfully and knowingly joining a
group (al Qaeda) whose purpose is “to support violent attacks against
property and nationals (both military and civilian) of the United
States.” \\Id.,\\ at 64a; 344 F. Supp. 2d, at 161. Moreover, the
allegations specify that Hamdan joined and maintained his relationship
with al Qaeda even though he “believed that Usama bin Laden and his
associates were involved in the attacks on the U. S. Embassies in Kenya
and Tanzania in August 1998, the attack on the USS COLE in October
2000, and the attacks on the United States on September 11, 2001.”
App. to Pet. for Cert. 65a. These allegations, against a confirmed
unlawful combatant, are alone sufficient to sustain the jurisdiction of
Hamdan’s military commission.

  For well over a century it has been established that “to unite with
banditti, jayhawkers, guerillas, or any other unauthorized marauders
is a high offence against the laws of war; \\the offence is complete
when the band is organized or joined. The atrocities committed by
such a band do not constitute the offence, but make the reasons, and
sufficient reasons they are, why such banditti are denounced by the
laws of\\ @@694@@ \\war.\\” 11 Op. Atty. Gen., at 312 (emphasis
added).[[8]] In other words, unlawful combatants, such as Hamdan,
violate the law of war merely by joining an organization, such as al
Qaeda, whose principal purpose is the “killing [and] disabling. . .of
peaceable citizens or soldiers.” Winthrop 784; see also 11 Op.
Atty. Gen., at 314 (“A bushwhacker, a jayhawker, a bandit, a war
rebel, an assassin, being public enemies, may be tried, condemned, and
executed as offenders against the laws of war”). This conclusion is
unsurprising, as it is a “cardinal principle of the law of war .
. . that the civilian population must enjoy complete immunity.” 4
Int’l Comm. of Red Cross, Commentary: Geneva Convention Relative to
the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War 3 (J. Pictet gen.
ed. 1958). “Numerous instances of trials, for ‘Violation of the
laws of war,’ of offenders of this description, are published in
the General Orders of the years 1862 to 1866.” Winthrop 784, and n.
57.[[9]] Accordingly, on this basis alone, @@695@@ “the allegations
of [Hamdan’s] charge, tested by any reasonable standard, adequately
allege a violation of the law of war.” \\Yamashita,\\ 327 U. S., at

^8 These observations respecting the law of war were made by the
Attorney General in defense of the military commission trial of the
Lincoln conspirators. As the foregoing quoted portion of that opinion
makes clear, the Attorney General did not, as the plurality maintains,
“trea[t] the charge as if it alleged the substantive offense of
assassination.” \\Ante,\\ at 604, n. 35. Rather, he explained that
the conspirators’ “high offence against the laws of war” was
“complete” when their band was “organized or joined,” and did
not depend upon “atrocities committed by such a band.” 11 Op. Atty.
Gen. 297, 312 (1865). Moreover, the Attorney General’s conclusions
specifically refute the plurality’s unsupported suggestion that I have
blurred the line between “those categories of ‘offender’ who may
be tried by military commission. . . with the ‘offenses’ that may be
so tried.” \\Ante,\\ at 601, n. 32.

^9 The General Orders establishing the jurisdiction for military
commissions during the Civil War provided that such offenses were
violations of the laws of war cognizable before military commissions.
See H. R. Doc. No. 65, 55th Cong., 3d Sess., 164 (1894) (“[P]ersons

  The conclusion that membership in an organization whose purpose is to
violate the laws of war is an offense triable by military commission is
confirmed by the experience of the @@696@@ military tribunals convened
by the United States at Nuremberg. Pursuant to Article 10 of the Charter
of the International Military Tribunal (IMT), the United States convened
military tribunals “to bring individuals to trial for membership”
in “a group or organization. . . declared criminal by the [IMT].” 1
Trials of War Criminals Before the Nuernberg Military Tribunals, p. XII,
Art. 10 (hereinafter Trials). The IMT designated various components
of four Nazi groups—the Leadership Corps, Gestapo, SD, and SS—
as criminal organizations. 22 IMT, Trial of the Major War Criminals
505, 511, 517 (1948); see also T. Taylor, Anatomy of the Nuremberg
Trials: A Personal Memoir 584–585 (1992). “[A] member of [such]
an organization [could] be . . . convicted of the crime of membership
and be punished for that crime by death.” 22 IMT, at 499. Under this
authority, the United States Military Tribunal at Nuremberg convicted
numerous individuals for the act of knowing and voluntary membership
in these organizations. For example, in Military Tribunal Case No. 1,
\\United States\\ v. \\Brandt,\\ Karl Brandt, Karl Gebhardt, Rudolf
Brandt, Joachim Mrugowsky, Wolfram Sievers, Viktor Brack, and Waldemar
Hoven were convicted and sentenced to death for the crime of, \\inter
alia,\\ membership in an organization declared criminal by the IMT;
Karl Genzken and Fritz Fischer were sentenced to life imprisonment for
the same; and Helmut Poppendick was convicted of no other offense than
membership in a criminal organization and sentenced to a 10-year term
of imprisonment. 2 Trials 180–300. This Court denied habeas relief,
333 U. S. 836 (1948), and the executions were carried out at Landsberg
prison on June 2, 1948. 2 Trials 330.

  Moreover, the Government has alleged that Hamdan was not only a
  member of al Qaeda while it was carrying out terrorist attacks on
  civilian targets in the United States and abroad, but also that
  Hamdan aided and assisted al Qaeda’s top leadership by supplying
  weapons, transportation, and other services. App. to Pet. for Cert.
  65a–67a. These alle@@697@@gations further confirm that Hamdan is
  triable before a law-of-war military commission for his involvement
  with al Qaeda. See H. R. Doc. No. 65, 55th Cong., 3d Sess., 234 (1894)
  (“[T]here are numerous rebels . . . that . . . furnish the enemy
  with arms, provisions, clothing, horses and means of transportation;
  [such] insurgents are banding together in several of the interior
  counties for the purpose of assisting the enemy to rob, to maraud and

  (emphasis added)); Winthrop 840 (including in the list of offenses
  triable by law-of-war military commissions “dealing with . . .
  enemies, or furnishing them with money, arms, provisions, medicines, &
  c.”).[[10]] Undoubtedly, the conclusion that such conduct violates
  the law of war led to the enactment of Article 104 of the UCMJ, which
  provides that “[a]ny person who . . . aids, or attempts to aid, the
  enemy with arms, ammunition, supplies, money, or other things . . .
  shall suffer death or such other punishment as a court-martial or
  military commission may direct.” 10 U. S. C. § 904.

### 2

  Separate and apart from the offense of joining a contingent of
“uncivilized combatants who [are] not. . . likely to respect the laws
of war,” Winthrop 784, Hamdan has been charged with “conspir[ing]
and agree[ing] with . . . the al Qaida organization . . . to commit .
. . offenses triable by military commission,” App. to Pet. for Cert.
65a. Those offenses include “attacking civilians; attacking civilian
objects; murder by an unprivileged belligerent; and terrorism.”
\\Ibid.\\ This, @@698@@ too, alleges a violation of the law of war
triable by military commission.

^10 Even if the plurality were correct that a membership offense must be
accompanied by allegations that the “defendant ‘took up arms,’”
\\ante,\\ at 601, n. 32, that requirement has easily been satisfied
here. Not only has Hamdan been charged with providing assistance to top
al Qaeda leadership (itself an offense triable by military commission),
he has also been charged with receiving weapons training at an al Qaeda
camp. App. to Pet. for Cert. 66a–67a.

  “[T]he experience of our wars,” Winthrop 839, is rife with
evidence that establishes beyond any doubt that conspiracy to violate
the laws of war is itself an offense cognizable before a law-of-war
military commission. World War II provides the most recent examples of
the use of American military commissions to try offenses pertaining to
violations of the laws of war. In that conflict, the orders establishing
the jurisdiction of military commissions in various theaters of
operation provided that conspiracy to violate the laws of war was a
cognizable offense. See Letter, General Headquarters, United States
Army Forces, Pacific (Sept. 24, 1945), Record in \\Yamashita\\ v.
\\Styer,\\ O. T. 1945, No. 672, pp. 14, 16 (Exh. F) (Order respecting
the “Regulations Governing the Trial of War Criminals” provided
that “participation in a common plan or conspiracy to accomplish”
various offenses against the law of war was cognizable before military
commissions); 1 U. N. War Crimes Commission, Law Reports of Trials
of War Criminals 114–115 (1947) (reprint 1997) (hereinafter U. N.
Commission) (recounting that the orders establishing World War II
military commissions in the Pacific and China included “participation
in a common plan or conspiracy” pertaining to certain violations of
the laws of war as an offense triable by military commission). Indeed,
those orders authorized trial by military commission of participation
in a conspiracy to commit “ ‘murder . . . or other inhumane acts .
. . against any civilian population,’ ” \\id.,\\ at 114, which is
precisely the offense Hamdan has been charged with here. And conspiracy
to violate the laws of war was charged in the highest profile case tried
before a World War II military commission, see \\Quirin,\\ 317 U. S.,
at 23, and on numerous other occasions. See, \\e. g., Colepaugh\\ v.
\\Looney,\\ 235 F. 2d 429, 431 (CA10 1956); Green 848 (describing the
conspiracy trial of Julius Otto Kuehn). @@699@@

  To support its contrary conclusion, \\ante,\\ at 600, the plurality
attempts to evade the import of \\Quirin\\ (and the other World War
II authorities) by resting upon this Court’s failure to address the
sufficiency of the conspiracy charge in the \\Quirin\\ case, \\ante,\\
at 605–607. But the common law of war cannot be ascertained from this
Court’s failure to pass upon an issue, or indeed to even mention the
issue in its opinion;[[11]] rather, it is ascertained by the practice
and usage of war. Winthrop 839; \\supra,\\ at 689–690.

  The Civil War experience provides further support for the
President’s conclusion that conspiracy to violate the laws of war is
an offense cognizable before law-of-war military commissions. Indeed,
in the highest profile case to be tried before a military commission
relating to that war, namely, the trial of the men involved in the
assassination of President Lincoln, the charge provided that those men
had “combin[ed], confederat[ed], and conspir[ed] . . . to kill and
murder” President Lincoln. G. C. M. O. No. 356 (1865), reprinted in H.
R. Doc. No. 314, 55th Cong., 3d Sess., 696 (1899) (hereinafter G. C. M.
O. No. 356).[[12]] @@700@@

^11 The plurality recounts the respective claims of the parties in
\\Quirin\\ pertaining to this issue and cites the United States Reports.
\\Ante,\\ at 605. But the claims of the parties are not included in the
opinion of the Court, but rather in the sections of the Reports entitled
“Argument for Petitioners” and “Argument for Respondent.” See
317 U. S., at 6–17.

^12 The plurality concludes that military commission jurisdiction was
appropriate in the case of the Lincoln conspirators because they were
charged with “ ‘maliciously, unlawfully, and traitorously murdering
the said Abraham Lincoln,’ ” \\ante,\\ at 604, n. 35. But the sole
charge filed in that case alleged conspiracy, and the allegations
pertaining to “maliciously, unlawfully, and traitorously murdering
the said Abraham Lincoln” were not charged or labeled as separate
offenses, but rather as overt acts “in pursuance of and in prosecuting
said malicious, unlawful, and traitorous \\conspiracy.\\” G. C. M.
O. No. 356, at 696 (emphasis added). While the plurality contends the
murder of President Lincoln was charged as a distinct separate offense,
the foregoing quoted language of the charging document unequivocally
establishes otherwise. Moreover, though I agree that the allegations
pertaining to these overt acts provided an independ@@700@@ent basis
for the military commission’s jurisdiction in that case, that merely
confirms the propriety of examining all the acts alleged—whether or
not they are labeled as separate offenses—to determine if a defendant
has been charged with a violation of the law of war. As I have already
explained, Hamdan has been charged with violating the law of war not
only by participating in a conspiracy to violate the law of war, but
also by joining a war-criminal enterprise and by supplying provisions
and assistance to that enterprise’s top leadership.

  In addition to the foregoing high-profile example, Winthrop’s
treatise enumerates numerous Civil War military commission trials
for conspiracy to violate the law of war. Winthrop 839, n. 5. The
plurality attempts to explain these examples away by suggesting that
the conspiracies listed by Winthrop are best understood as “a species
of compound offense,” namely, violations both of the law of war and
ordinary criminal laws, rather than “stand-alone offense[s] against
the law of war.” \\Ante,\\ at 608 (citing, as an example, murder
in violation of the laws of war). But the fact that, for example,
conspiracy to commit murder can at the same time violate ordinary
criminal laws and the law of war, so that it is “a combination of
the two species of offenses,” Howland 1071, does not establish that
a military commission would not have jurisdiction to try that crime
solely on the basis that it was a violation of the law of war. Rather,
if anything, and consistent with the principle that the common law of
war is flexible and affords some level of deference to the judgments of
military commanders, it establishes that military commissions would have
the discretion to try the offense as (1) one against the law of war, or
(2) one against the ordinary criminal laws, or (3) both.

  In any event, the plurality’s effort to avoid the import of
Winthrop’s footnote through the smokescreen of its “compound
offense” theory, \\ante,\\ at 607–608, cannot be reconciled with
the particular charges that sustained military commission jurisdiction
in the cases that Winthrop cites. For ex@@701@@ample, in the military
commission trial of Henry Wirz, Charge I provided that he had been

    “[m]aliciously, willfully, and traitorously. . . \\combining,
confederating, and conspiring,\\ together [with various other named and
unnamed co-conspirators], to injure the health and destroy the lives of
soldiers in the military service of the United States, then held and
being prisoners of war within the lines of the so-called Confederate
States, and in the military prisons thereof, to the end that the armies
of the United States might be weakened and impaired, \\in violation of
the laws and customs of war.\\” G. C. M. O. No. 607 (1865), reprinted
in H. R. Doc. No. 314, at 785 (emphasis added).

Likewise, in the military commission trial of Leger Grenfel, Charge
I accused Grenfel of “\\[c]onspiring, in violation of the laws of
war,\\ to release rebel prisoners of war confined by authority of the
United States at Camp Douglas, near Chicago, Ill.” G. C. M. O. No. 452
(1865), reprinted in H. R. Doc. No. 314, at 724 (emphasis added);[[13]]
see also G. C. M. O. @@702@@ No. 41, p. 20 (1864) (indictment in the
military commission trial of Robert Louden charged “ ‘[c]onspiring
with the rebel enemies of the United States to embarrass and impede the
military authorities in the suppression of the existing rebellion, by
the burning and destruction of steamboats and means of transportation on
the Mississippi river’ ”). These examples provide incontrovertible
support for the President’s conclusion that the common law of war
permits military commission trials for conspiracy to violate the law
of war. And they specifically contradict the plurality’s conclusion
to the contrary, thereby easily satisfying its requirement that the
Government “make a substantial showing that the crime for which it
seeks to try a defendant by military commission is acknowledged to be an
offense against the law of war.” \\Ante,\\ at 603.[[14]] @@703@@

^13 The plurality’s attempt to undermine the significance of these
cases is unpersuasive. The plurality suggests the Wirz case is not
relevant because the specification supporting his conspiracy charge
alleged that he “\\personally committed\\ a number of atrocities.”
\\Ante,\\ at 609. But this does not establish that conspiracy to
violate the laws of war, the very crime with which Wirz was charged,
is not itself a violation of the law of war. Rather, at best, it
establishes that in addition to conspiracy Wirz violated the laws of war
by committing various atrocities, just as Hamdan violated the laws of
war not only by conspiring to do so, but also by joining al Qaeda and
providing provisions and services to its top leadership. Moreover, the
fact that Wirz was charged with overt acts that are more severe than
the overt acts with which Hamdan has been charged does not establish
that conspiracy is not an offense cognizable before military commission;
rather it merely establishes that Wirz’s offenses may have been
comparably worse than Hamdan’s offenses.

  ^ The plurality’s claim that the charge against Leger Grenfel
supports its compound offense theory is similarly unsupportable. The
plurality does not, and cannot, dispute that Grenfel was charged
with conspiring to vio@@702@@late the laws of war by releasing rebel
prisoners—a charge that bears no relation to a crime “ordinarily
triable in civilian courts.” \\Ante,\\ at 609, n. 37. Tellingly, the
plurality does not reference or discuss this charge, but instead refers
to the conclusion of Judge Advocate Holt that Grenfel also “ ‘united
himself with traitors and malefactors for the overthrow of our Republic
in the interest of slavery.’ ” \\Ante,\\ at 610, n. 37 (quoting
H. R. Doc. No. 314, at 689). But Judge Advocate Holt’s observation
provides no support for the plurality’s conclusion, as it does not
discuss the charges that sustained military commission jurisdiction,
much less suggest that such charges were not violations of the law of
war.

^14 The plurality contends that international practice—including
the practice of the IMT at Nuremberg—supports its conclusion that
conspiracy is not an offense triable by military commission because “
‘[t]he Anglo- American concept of conspiracy was not part of European
legal systems and arguably not an element of the internationally
recognized laws of war.’ ” \\Ante,\\ at 611 (quoting T. Taylor,
Anatomy of the Nuremberg Trials: A Personal Memoir 36 (1992)). But while
the IMT did not criminalize all conspiracies to violate the law of war,
it did criminalize “participation in a common plan or conspiracy” to
wage aggressive war. See 1 Trials, at XI–XII, Art. 6(a). Moreover, the
World War II military tribunals of several European nations recognized
conspiracy to violate the laws of war as an offense triable before
military commissions. See 15 U. N. Commission 90–91 (noting that the
French Military Tribunal at Marseilles found Henri Georges Stadelhofer
“guilty of the crime of \\association de malfaiteurs,\\” namely, of
“ ‘having formed with various members of the @@703@@ German Gestapo
an association with the aim of preparing or committing crimes against
persons or property, without justification under the laws and usages of
war’ ”); 11 \\id.,\\ at 98 (noting that the Netherlands’ military
tribunals were authorized to try conspiracy to violate the laws of war).
Thus, the European legal systems’ approach to domestic conspiracy law
has not prevented European nations from recognizing conspiracy offenses
as violations of the law of war. This is unsurprising, as the law of
war is derived not from domestic law but from the wartime practices of
civilized nations, including the United States, which has consistently
recognized that conspiracy to violate the laws of war is an offense
triable by military commission.

  The plurality further contends, in reliance upon Winthrop, that
  conspiracy is not an offense cognizable before a law-of-war military
  commission because “it is not enough to intend to violate the
  law of war and commit overt acts in furtherance of that intention
  unless the overt acts either are themselves offenses against the
  law of war or constitute steps sufficiently substantial to qualify
  as an attempt\\.” Ante,\\ at 604. But Winthrop does not support
  the plurality’s conclusion. The passage in Winthrop cited by the
  plurality states only that “the jurisdiction of the military
  commission should be restricted to cases of offence consisting in
  \\overt acts, i. e.\\ in unlawful commissions or actual attempts to
  commit, and not in intentions merely.” Winthrop 841 (emphasis in
  original). This passage would be helpful to the plurality if its
  subject were “conspiracy,” rather than the “jurisdiction of
  the military commission.” Winthrop is not speaking here of the
  requirements for a conspiracy charge, but of the requirements for
  \\all\\ charges. Intentions do not suffice. An unlawful act—such
  as committing the crime of conspiracy—is necessary. Winthrop says
  nothing to exclude either conspiracy or membership in a criminal
  enterprise, both of which go beyond “intentions merely” and
  “consis[t of] \\overt acts, i. e.\\ . . . unlawful commissions or
  actual attempts to commit,” and both of which are \\expressly\\
  recognized by Winthrop as crimes against the law of war triable by
  military commissions. \\Id.,\\ at 784; \\id.,\\ at 839, and n. 5,
  840. Indeed, the @@704@@ commission of an \\“overt ac[t]”\\
  is the traditional requirement for the completion of the crime of
  conspiracy, and the charge against Hamdan alleges numerous such
  overt acts. App. to Pet. for Cert. 65a. The plurality’s approach,
  unsupported by Winthrop, requires that any overt act to further a
  conspiracy must \\itself\\ be a completed war crime \\distinct from
  conspiracy\\—which merely begs the question the plurality sets
  out to answer, namely, whether conspiracy itself may constitute a
  violation of the law of war. And, even the plurality’s unsupported
  standard is satisfied here. Hamdan has been charged with the overt
  acts of providing protection, transportation, weapons, and other
  services to the enemy, \\id.,\\ at 65a–67a, acts which in and of
  themselves are violations of the laws of war. See \\supra,\\ at
  696–697; Winthrop 839–840.

### 3

  Ultimately, the plurality’s determination that Hamdan has not been
charged with an offense triable before a military commission rests not
upon any historical example or authority, but upon the plurality’s raw
judgment of the “inability on the Executive’s part here to satisfy
the most basic precondition. . .for establishment of military commissions:
military necessity.” \\Ante,\\ at 612. This judgment starkly confirms
that the plurality has appointed itself the ultimate arbiter of what is
quintessentially a policy and military judgment, namely, the appropriate
military measures to take against those who “aided the terrorist
attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001.” AUMF § 2(a), 115
Stat. 224. The plurality’s suggestion that Hamdan’s commission
is illegitimate because it is not dispensing swift justice on the
battlefield is unsupportable. \\Ante,\\ at 607. Even a cursory review
of the authorities confirms that law-of-war military commissions have
wide-ranging jurisdiction to try offenses against the law of war in
exigent and nonexigent circumstances alike. See, \\e. g.,\\ Winthrop
839–840; see also \\Yamashita,\\ 327 U. S., at 5 (military commission
trial after the cessa@@705@@tion of hostilities in the Philippines);
\\Quirin,\\ 317 U.S. 1 (military commission trial in Washington, D.
C.). Traditionally, retributive justice for heinous war crimes is as
much a “military necessity” as the “demands” of “military
efficiency” touted by the plurality, and swift military retribution
is precisely what Congress authorized the President to impose on the
September 11 attackers in the AUMF.

  Today a plurality of this Court would hold that conspiracy to
massacre innocent civilians does not violate the laws of war. This
determination is unsustainable. The judgment of the political branches
that Hamdan, and others like him, must be held accountable before
military commissions for their involvement with and membership in
an unlawful organization dedicated to inflicting massive civilian
casualties is supported by virtually every relevant authority, including
all of the authorities invoked by the plurality today. It is also
supported by the nature of the present conflict. We are not engaged
in a traditional battle with a nation-state, but with a worldwide,
hydra-headed enemy, who lurks in the shadows conspiring to reproduce the
atrocities of September 11, 2001, and who has boasted of sending suicide
bombers into civilian gatherings, has proudly distributed videotapes
of beheadings of civilian workers, and has tortured and dismembered
captured American soldiers. But according to the plurality, when our
Armed Forces capture those who are plotting terrorist atrocities like
the bombing of the Khobar Towers, the bombing of the U. S. S. \\Cole,\\
and the attacks of September 11—even if their plots are advanced
to the very brink of fulfillment—our military cannot charge those
criminals with any offense against the laws of war. Instead, our troops
must catch the terrorists “redhanded,” \\ante,\\ at 612, in the
midst of \\the attack itself,\\ in order to bring them to justice. Not
only is this conclusion fundamentally inconsistent with the cardinal
principle of the law of war, namely, protecting noncombatants, but it
would sorely hamper the President’s ability to confront and defeat a
new and deadly enemy. @@706@@

  After seeing the plurality overturn longstanding precedents in
order to seize jurisdiction over this case, \\ante,\\ at 656–658
(S<<calia,>> J., dissenting), and after seeing them disregard the clear
prudential counsel that they abstain in these circumstances from using
equitable powers, \\ante,\\ at 672–678, it is no surprise to see them
go on to overrule one after another of the President’s judgments
pertaining to the conduct of an ongoing war. Those Justices who today
disregard the Commander in Chief’s wartime decisions, only 10 days
ago deferred to the judgment of the Corps of Engineers with regard
to a matter much more within the competence of lawyers, upholding
that agency’s wildly implausible conclusion that a storm drain is
a tributary of the waters of the United States. See \\Rapanos\\ v.
\\United States,\\ 547 U. S. 715 (2006). It goes without saying that
there is much more at stake here than storm drains. The plurality’s
willingness to secondguess the determination of the political branches
that these conspirators must be brought to justice is both unprecedented
and dangerous.

# III

  The Court holds that even if “the Government has charged Hamdan with
an offense against the law of war cognizable by military commission, the
commission lacks power to proceed” because of its failure to comply
with the terms of the UCMJ and the four Geneva Conventions signed in
1949. \\Ante,\\ at 613. This position is untenable.

## A

  As with the jurisdiction of military commissions, the procedure
of such commissions “has [not] been prescribed by statute,” but
“has been adapted in each instance to the need that called it
forth.” \\Madsen,\\ 343 U. S., at 347–348. Indeed, this Court has
concluded that “[i]n the absence of attempts by Congress to limit
the President’s power, it appears that, as Commander-in-Chief of the
Army and Navy of the United States, he may, in time of war, establish
and prescribe @@707@@ the jurisdiction and procedure of military
commissions.” \\Id.,\\ at 348. This conclusion is consistent with this
Court’s understanding that military commissions are “our common-law
war courts.” \\Id.,\\ at 346–347.[[15]] As such, “[s]hould the
conduct of those who compose martial-law tribunals become [a] matter
of judicial determination subsequently before the civil courts, those
courts will give great weight to the opinions of the officers as to
what the customs of war in any case justify and render necessary.”
Birkhimer 534. @@708@@

^15 Though it does not constitute a basis for any holding of the Court,
the Court maintains that, as a “general rule,” “the procedures
governing trials by military commission historically have been the same
as those governing courts-martial.” \\Ante,\\ at 617. While it is
undoubtedly true that military commissions have invariably employed most
of the procedures employed by courts-martial, that is not a requirement.
See Winthrop 841 (“[M]ilitary commissions. . . are commonly conducted
according to the rules and forms governing courts-martial. These
war-courts are indeed more summary in their action than are the courts
held under the Articles of war, and . . . their proceedings. . . will
not be rendered \\illegal\\ by the omission of details required upon
trials by courts-martial” (emphasis in original; footnotes omitted));
1 U. N. Commission 116–117 (“The [World War II] Mediterranean
Regulations (No. 8) provide that Military Commissions shall conduct
their proceedings as may be deemed necessary for full and fair trial,
having regard for, \\but not being bound by,\\ the rules of procedure
prescribed for General Courts Martial” (emphasis added)); \\id.,\\ at
117 (“In the [World War II] European directive it is stated. . . that
Military Commissions shall have power to make, as occasion requires,
such rules for the conduct of their proceedings consistent with the
powers of such Commissions, and with the rules of procedure . . . as
are deemed necessary for a full and fair trial of the accused, having
regard for, without being bound by, the rules of procedure and evidence
prescribed for General Courts Martial”). Moreover, such a requirement
would conflict with the settled understanding of the flexible and
responsive nature of military commissions and the President’s wartime
authority to employ such tribunals as he sees fit. See Birkhimer
537–538 (“[M]ilitary commissions may so vary their procedure as to
adapt it to any situation, and may extend their powers to any necessary
degree. . . . The military commander decides upon the character of the
military tribunal which is suited to the occasion. . .and his decision is
final”).

  The Court nevertheless concludes that at least one provision of the
UCMJ amounts to an attempt by Congress to limit the President’s
power. This conclusion is not only contrary to the text and structure
of the UCMJ, but it is also inconsistent with precedent of this Court.
Consistent with \\Madsen\\’s conclusion pertaining to the common-law
nature of military commissions and the President’s discretion to
prescribe their procedures, Article 36 of the UCMJ authorizes the
President to establish procedures for military commissions “which
shall, \\so far as he considers practicable,\\ apply the principles
of law and the rules of evidence generally recognized in the trial of
criminal cases in the United States district courts, but which may not
be contrary to or inconsistent with this chapter.” 10 U. S. C.
§ 836(a) (emphasis added). Far from constraining the President’s
authority, Article 36 recognizes the President’s prerogative to depart
from the procedures applicable in criminal cases whenever \\he alone\\
does not deem such procedures “practicable.” While the procedural
regulations promulgated by the Executive must not be “contrary
to” the UCMJ, only a few provisions of the UCMJ mention “military
commissions,” see \\ante,\\ at 621, n. 49, and there is no suggestion
that the procedures to be employed by Hamdan’s commission implicate
any of those provisions.

  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Court concludes that Article 36(b)
of the UCMJ, 10 U. S. C. §836(b), which provides that “[a]ll rules
and regulations made under this article shall be uniform insofar as
practicable,” \\ante,\\ at 620, requires the President to employ the
same rules and procedures in military commissions as are employed by
courts-martial \\“‘insofar as practicable,’” ante,\\ at 622. The
Court further concludes that Hamdan’s commission is unlawful because
the President has not explained why it is not practicable to apply the
same rules and procedures to Hamdan’s commission as would be applied
in a trial by court-martial. \\Ante,\\ at 623–624. @@709@@

  This interpretation of § 836(b) is unconvincing. As an initial
matter, the Court fails to account for our cases interpreting the
predecessor to Article 21 of the UCMJ—Article 15 of the Articles of
War—which provides crucial context that bears directly on the proper
interpretation of Article 36(b). Article 15 of the Articles of War
provided that:

    “The provisions of these articles conferring jurisdiction upon
courts-martial shall not be construed as depriving military commissions,
provost courts, or other military tribunals of concurrent jurisdiction
in respect of offenders or offenses that by statute or by the law of war
may be triable by such military commissions, provost courts, or other
military tribunals.” 41 Stat. 790.

In \\Yamashita,\\ this Court concluded that Article 15 of the Articles
of War preserved the President’s unfettered authority to prescribe
military commission procedure. The Court explained, “[b]y thus
recognizing military commissions in order to preserve their traditional
jurisdiction over enemy combatants unimpaired by the Articles, Congress
gave sanction. . .to \\any use\\ of the military commission contemplated
by the common law of war.” 327 U. S., at 20 (emphasis added);[[16]]
see also \\Quirin,\\ 317 U. S., at 28; \\Madsen,\\ 343 U. S., at 355.
In reaching this conclusion, this Court treated as authoritative the
congressional testimony of Judge Advo@@710@@cate General Crowder,
who testified that Article 15 of the Articles of War was enacted to
preserve the military commission as “ ‘our common-law war court.’
” \\Yamashita, supra,\\ at 19, n. 7. And this Court recognized that
Article 15’s preservation of military commissions as common-law war
courts preserved the President’s Commander in Chief authority to
both “establish” military commissions and to “prescribe [their]
procedure[s].” \\Madsen,\\ 343 U. S., at 348; \\id.,\\ at 348–349
(explaining that Congress had “refrain[ed] from legislating” in
the area of military commission procedures, in “contras[t] with its
traditional readiness to . . . prescrib[e], with particularity, the
jurisdiction and procedure of United States courts-martial”); cf.
Green 834 (“The military commission exercising jurisdiction under
common law authority is usually appointed by a superior military
commander and is limited in its procedure only by the will of that
commander. Like any other common law court, in the absence of directive
of superior authority to the contrary, the military commission is free
to formulate its own rules of procedure”).

^16 The Court suggests that Congress’ amendment to Article 2 of the
UCMJ, providing that the UCMJ applies to “persons within an area
leased by or otherwise reserved or acquired for the use of the United
States,” 10 U. S. C. § 802(a)(12), deprives \\Yamashita\\’s
conclusion respecting the President’s authority to promulgate military
commission procedures of its “precedential value.” \\Ante,\\ at
620. But this merely begs the question of the scope and content of
the remaining provisions of the UCMJ. Nothing in the additions to
Article 2, or any other provision of the UCMJ, suggests that Congress
has disturbed this Court’s unequivocal interpretation of Article
21 as preserving the common-law status of military commissions and
the corresponding authority of the President to set their procedures
pursuant to his Commander in Chief powers. See \\Quirin,\\ 317 U. S.,
at 28; \\Yamashita,\\ 327 U. S., at 20; \\Madsen\\ v. \\Kinsella,\\ 343
U. S. 341, 355 (1952).

  Given these precedents, the Court’s conclusion that Article 36(b)
  requires the President to apply the same rules and procedures
  to military commissions as are applicable to courts-martial is
  unsustainable. When Congress codified Article 15 of the Articles of
  War in Article 21 of the UCMJ it was “presumed to be aware of . .
  . and to adopt” this Court’s interpretation of that provision as
  preserving the common-law status of military commissions, inclusive of
  the President’s unfettered authority to prescribe their procedures.
  \\Lorillard\\ v. \\Pons,\\ 434 U. S. 575, 580 (1978). The Court’s
  conclusion that Article 36(b) repudiates this settled meaning of
  Article 21 is not based upon a specific textual reference to military
  commissions, but rather on a one-sentence subsection providing that
  “[a]ll rules and regulations made under this article shall be
  uniform insofar as practicable.” 10 U. S. C. § 836(b). This
  is little more than an impermissible repeal by implication. @@711@@
  See \\Branch\\ v. \\Smith,\\ 538 U. S. 254, 273 (2003) (plurality
  opinion) (“We have repeatedly stated . . . that absent a clearly
  expressed congressional intention, repeals by implication are not
  favored” (citations and internal quotation marks omitted)).
  Moreover, the Court’s conclusion is flatly contrary to its duty
  not to set aside Hamdan’s commission “without the \\clear\\
  conviction that [it is] in conflict with the . . . laws of Congress
  constitutionally enacted.” \\Quirin, supra,\\ at 25 (emphasis
  added).

  Nothing in the text of Article 36(b) supports the Court’s sweeping
conclusion that it represents an unprecedented congressional effort to
change the nature of military commissions from common-law war courts
to tribunals that must presumptively function like courts-martial. And
such an interpretation would be strange indeed. The vision of uniformity
that motivated the adoption of the UCMJ, embodied specifically in
Article 36(b), is nothing more than uniformity across the separate
branches of the armed services. See Act of May 5, 1950, ch. 169, 64
Stat. 107 (preamble to the UCMJ explaining that the UCMJ is an Act
“[t]o unify, consolidate, revise, and codify the Articles of War,
the Articles for the Government of the Navy, and the disciplinary
laws of the Coast Guard”). There is no indication that the UCMJ was
intended to require uniformity in procedure between courts-martial
and military commissions, tribunals that the UCMJ itself recognizes
are different. To the contrary, the UCMJ expressly recognizes that
different tribunals will be constituted in different manners and
employ different procedures. See 10 U. S. C. § 866 (providing
for three different types of courts-martial—general, special, and
summary—constituted in different manners and employing different
procedures). Thus, Article 36(b) is best understood as establishing
that, so far as practicable, the rules and regulations governing
tribunals convened by the Navy must be uniform with the rules and
regulations governing tribunals convened by the Army. But, consistent
with this Court’s prior interpreta@@712@@tions of Article 21 and over
a century of historical practice, it cannot be understood to require the
President to conform the procedures employed by military commissions to
those employed by courts-martial.[[17]]

  Even if Article 36(b) could be construed to require procedural
uniformity among the various tribunals contemplated by the UCMJ,
Hamdan would not be entitled to relief. Under the Court’s reading,
the President is entitled to prescribe different rules for military
commissions than for courts-martial when he determines that it is
not “practicable” to prescribe uniform rules. The Court does
not resolve the level of deference such determinations would be
owed, however, because, in its view, “[t]he President has not .
. . [determined] that it is impracticable to apply the rules for
courts-martial.” \\Ante,\\ at 623. This is simply not the case.
On the same day that the President issued Military Commission Order
No. 1, the Secretary of Defense explained that “the president
decided to establish military commissions because he wanted the
option of a process that is different from those processes which we
already have, namely, the federal court system . . . and the military
court system,” Dept. of @@713@@ Defense News Briefing on Military
Commissions (Mar. 21, 2002) (remarks of Donald Rumsfeld), available
at http://www.dod.gov/transcripts/2002/t03212002_t0321sd.html (as
visited June 26, 2006, and available in Clerk of Court’s case file)
(hereinafter News Briefing), and that “[t]he commissions are intended
to be different. . . because the [P]resident recognized that there had to
be differences to deal with the unusual situation we face and that a
different approach was needed.” \\Ibid.\\ The President reached this
conclusion because

^17 It bears noting that while the Court does not hesitate to cite
legislative history that supports its view of certain statutory
provisions, see \\ante,\\ at 579, 580–581, n. 10, it makes no
citation of the legislative history pertaining to Article 36(b),
which contradicts its interpretation of that provision. Indeed, if
it were authoritative, the \\only\\ legislative history relating to
Article 36(b) would confirm the obvious—Article 36(b)’s uniformity
requirement pertains to uniformity between the three branches of the
Armed Forces, and no more. When that subsection was introduced as an
amendment to Article 36, its author explained that it would leave the
three branches “enough leeway to provide a different provision where
it is absolutely necessary” because “there are some differences in
the services.” Hearings on H. R. 2498 before the Subcommittee No. 1
of the House Committee on Armed Services, 81st Cong., 1st Sess., 1015
(1949). A further statement explained that “there might be some slight
differences that would pertain as to the Navy in contrast to the Army,
but at least [Article 36(b)] is an expression of the congressional
intent that we want it to be as uniform as possible.” \\Ibid.\\

    “we’re in the middle of a war, and . . . had to design a
procedure that would allow us to pursue justice for these individuals
while at the same time prosecuting the war most effectively. And that
means setting rules that would allow us to preserve our intelligence
secrets, develop more information about terrorist activities that
might be planned for the future so that we can take action to prevent
terrorist attacks against the United States. . . . [T]here was a
constant balancing of the requirements of our war policy and the
importance of providing justice for the individuals . . . and \\each\\
deviation from the standard kinds of rules that we have in our criminal
courts was motivated by the desire to strike this balance between
individual justice and the broader war policy.” \\Ibid.\\ (remarks
of Douglas J. Feith, Under Secretary of Defense for Policy (emphasis
added)).

The Court provides no explanation why the President’s determination
that employing court-martial procedures in the military commissions
established pursuant to Military Commission Order No. 1 would hamper
our war effort is in any way inadequate to satisfy its newly minted
“practicability” requirement. On the contrary, this determination
is precisely the kind for which the “Judiciary has neither aptitude,
facilities nor responsibility and which has long been held to belong in
the domain of political power not subject to judicial @@714@@ intrusion
or inquiry.’ ” \\Chicago & Southern Air Lines, Inc.\\ v. \\Waterman
S. S. Corp.,\\ 333 U. S., at 111. And, in the context of the present
conflict, it is exactly the kind of determination Congress countenanced
when it authorized the President to use all necessary and appropriate
force against our enemies. Accordingly, the President’s determination
is sufficient to satisfy any practicability requirement imposed by
Article 36(b).

  The Court further contends that Hamdan’s commission is unlawful
because it fails to provide him the right to be present at his trial, as
recognized in 10 U. S. C. § 839(c) (2000 ed., Supp. V). \\Ante,\\ at
624. But § 839(c) applies to courts-martial, not military commissions.
It provides:

      “When the members of a court-martial deliberate or vote, only
the members may be present. All other proceedings, including any other
consultation of the members of the court with counsel or the military
judge, shall be made a part of the record and shall be in the presence
of the accused, the defense counsel, the trial counsel, and, in cases
in which a military judge has been detailed to the court, the military
judge.”

In context, “all other proceedings” plainly refers exclusively to
“other proceedings” pertaining to a court-martial.[[18]] This is
confirmed by the provision’s subsequent reference to “members of the
\\court\\” and to “cases in which a military judge has been detailed
to the \\court.\\” It is also confirmed by the other provisions of
§ 839, which refer only to courts-martial. See §§ 839(a)(1)–(4)
(“[A]ny time after the service of charges which have been referred
for trial to a courtmartial composed of a military judge and members,
the mili@@715@@tary judge may . . . call the court into session without
the presence of the members for the purpose of” hearing motions,
issuing rulings, holding arraignments, receiving pleas, and performing
various procedural functions). See also § 839(b) (“Proceedings under
subsection (a) shall be conducted in the presence of the accused”).
Section 839(c) simply does not address the procedural requirements of
military commissions.

^18 In addition to being foreclosed by the text of the provision, the
Court’s suggestion that 10 U. S. C. § 839(c) (2000 ed., Supp. V)
applies to military commissions is untenable because it would require,
in military commission proceedings, that the accused be present when the
members of the commission voted on his guilt or innocence.

## B

  The Court contends that Hamdan’s military commission is also
unlawful because it violates Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions,
see \\ante,\\ at 629–635. Furthermore, Hamdan contends that his
commission is unlawful because it violates various provisions of the
Third Geneva Convention. These contentions are untenable.

### 1

  As an initial matter, and as the Court of Appeals concluded, both of
Hamdan’s Geneva Convention claims are foreclosed by \\Johnson\\ v.
\\Eisentrager,\\ 339 U. S. 763 (1950). In that case the respondents
claimed, \\inter alia,\\ that their military commission lacked
jurisdiction because it failed to provide them with certain procedural
safeguards that they argued were required under the Geneva Conventions.
\\Id.,\\ at 789–790. While this Court rejected the underlying merits
of the respondents’ Geneva Convention claims, \\id.,\\ at 790, it
also held, in the alternative, that the respondents could “not assert
. . . that anything in the Geneva Convention makes them immune from
prosecution or punishment for war crimes,” \\id.,\\ at 789. The Court
explained:

      “We are not holding that these prisoners have no right which
the military authorities are bound to respect. The United States, by
the Geneva Convention of July 27, 1929, 47 Stat. 2021, concluded with
forty-six other countries, including the German Reich, an agreement
upon the treatment to be accorded captives. These @@716@@ prisoners
claim to be and are entitled to its protection. It is, however, the
obvious scheme of the Agreement that responsibility for observance and
enforcement of these rights is upon political and military authorities.
Rights of alien enemies are vindicated under it only through protests
and intervention of protecting powers as the rights of our citizens
against foreign governments are vindicated only by Presidential
intervention.” \\Id.,\\ at 789, n. 14.

This alternative holding is no less binding than if it were the
exclusive basis for the Court’s decision. See \\Massachusetts\\ v.
\\United States,\\ 333 U. S. 611, 623 (1948). While the Court attempts
to cast \\Eisentrager\\’s unqualified, alternative holding as footnote
dictum, \\ante,\\ at 627, it does not dispute the correctness of its
conclusion, namely, that the provisions of the 1929 Geneva Convention
were not judicially enforceable because that Convention contemplated
that diplomatic measures by political and military authorities were the
exclusive mechanisms for such enforcement. Nor does the Court suggest
that the 1949 Geneva Conventions departed from this framework. See
\\ibid.\\ (“We may assume that ‘the obvious scheme’ of the 1949
Conventions is identical in all relevant respects to that of the 1929
Convention”).

  Instead, the Court concludes that petitioner may seek judicial
enforcement of the provisions of the Geneva Conventions because “they
are . . . part of the law of war. And compliance with the law of war
is the condition upon which the authority set forth in Article 21
is granted.” \\Ante,\\ at 628 (citation omitted). But Article 21
authorizes the use of military commissions; it does not purport to
render judicially enforceable aspects of the law of war that are not
so enforceable of their own accord. See \\Quirin,\\ 317 U. S., at 28
(by enacting Article 21, “Congress has explicitly provided, so far
as it may constitutionally do so, that military tribunals shall have
jurisdiction to try offenders or offenses against the law of war”).
The Court cannot escape \\Eisentrager\\’s holding @@717@@ merely
by observing that Article 21 mentions the law of war; indeed, though
\\Eisentrager\\ did not specifically consider the Court’s novel
interpretation of Article 21, \\Eisentrager\\ involved a challenge to
the legality of a World War II military commission, which, like all
such commissions, found its authorization in Article 15 of the Articles
of War, the predecessor to Article 21 of the UCMJ. Thus, the Court’s
interpretation of Article 21 is foreclosed by \\Eisentrager.\\

  In any event, the Court’s argument is too clever by half. The
judicial nonenforceability of the Geneva Conventions derives from the
fact that those Conventions have exclusive enforcement mechanisms, see
\\Eisentrager, supra,\\ at 789, n. 14, and this, too, is part of the law
of war. The Court’s position thus rests on the assumption that Article
21’s reference to the “laws of war” selectively incorporates
only those aspects of the Geneva Conventions that the Court finds
convenient, namely, the substantive requirements of Common Article 3,
and not those aspects of the Conventions that the Court, for whatever
reason, disfavors, namely, the Conventions’ exclusive diplomatic
enforcement scheme. The Court provides no account of why the \\partial\\
incorporation of the Geneva Conventions should extend only so far—and
no further—because none is available beyond its evident preference
to adjudicate those matters that the law of war, through the Geneva
Conventions, consigns exclusively to the political branches.

  Even if the Court were correct that Article 21 of the UCMJ renders
judicially enforceable aspects of the law of war that are not so
enforceable by their own terms, Article 21 simply cannot be interpreted
to render judicially enforceable the particular provision of the law of
war at issue here, namely, Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions.
As relevant, Article 21 provides that “[t]he provisions of this
chapter conferring jurisdiction upon courts-martial do not deprive
military commissions . . . of concurrent jurisdiction with respect to
\\offenders or offenses\\ that by statute \\or by\\ @@718@@ \\the law
of war\\ may be tried by military commissions.” 10 U. S. C. § 821
(emphasis added). Thus, to the extent Article 21 can be interpreted as
authorizing judicial enforcement of aspects of the law of war that are
not otherwise judicially enforceable, that authorization only extends
to provisions of the law of war that relate to whether a particular
“offender” or a particular “offense” is triable by military
commission. Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions, the sole
provision of the Geneva Conventions relevant to the Court’s holding,
relates to neither. Rather, it relates exclusively to the particulars of
the tribunal itself, namely, whether it is “regularly constituted”
and whether it “afford[s] all the judicial guarantees which are
recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples.” Third Geneva
Convention, Art. 3, ¶ 1\\(d),\\ Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners
of War, Aug. 12, 1949, [1955] 6 U. S. T. 3316, 3320, T. I. A. S. No.

### 2

  In addition to being foreclosed by \\Eisentrager,\\ Hamdan’s
claim under Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions is meritless.
Common Article 3 applies to “armed conflict not of an international
character occurring in the territory of one of the High Contracting
Parties.” 6 U. S. T., at 3318. “Pursuant to [his] authority as
Commander in Chief and Chief Executive of the United States,” the
President has “accept[ed] the legal conclusion of the Department
of Justice . . . that common Article 3 of Geneva does not apply to
. . .al Qaeda. . .detainees, because, among other reasons, the relevant
conflicts are international in scope and common Article 3 applies only
to ‘armed conflict not of an international character.’” App. 35.
Under this Court’s precedents, “the meaning attributed to treaty
provisions by the Government agencies charged with their negotiation and
enforcement is entitled to great weight.” \\Sumitomo Shoji America,
Inc.\\ v. \\Avagliano,\\ 457 U. S. 176, 184–185 (1982); \\United
States\\ v. \\Stuart,\\ 489 U. S. 353, 369 (1989). Our duty to defer
to the @@719@@ President’s understanding of the provision at issue
here is only heightened by the fact that he is acting pursuant to his
constitutional authority as Commander in Chief and by the fact that the
subject matter of Common Article 3 calls for a judgment about the nature
and character of an armed conflict. See generally \\United States\\ v.
\\Curtiss-Wright Export Corp.,\\ 299 U. S. 304, 320 (1936).

  The President’s interpretation of Common Article 3 is reasonable
and should be sustained. The conflict with al Qaeda is international
in character in the sense that it is occurring in various nations
around the globe. Thus, it is also “occurring in the territory of”
more than “one of the High Contracting Parties.” The Court does
not dispute the President’s judgments respecting the nature of our
conflict with al Qaeda, nor does it suggest that the President’s
interpretation of Common Article 3 is implausible or foreclosed by the
text of the treaty. Indeed, the Court concedes that Common Article 3
is principally concerned with “furnish[ing] minimal protection to
rebels involved in. . .acivil war,” \\ante,\\ at 631, precisely the type
of conflict the President’s interpretation envisions to be subject
to Common Article 3. Instead, the Court, without acknowledging its
duty to defer to the President, adopts its own, admittedly plausible,
reading of Common Article 3. But where, as here, an ambiguous treaty
provision (“not of an international character”) is susceptible of
two plausible, and reasonable, interpretations, our precedents require
us to defer to the Executive’s interpretation.

  But even if Common Article 3 were judicially enforceable and
applicable to the present conflict, petitioner would not be entitled
to relief. As an initial matter, any claim petitioner has under Common
Article 3 is not ripe. The only relevant “acts” that “are and
shall remain prohibited” under Common Article 3 are “the \\passing
of sentences\\ and the \\carrying out of executions\\ without previous
judgment pro@@720@@nounced by a regularly constituted court affording
all the judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by
civilized peoples.” Art. 3, ¶ 1\\(d),\\ 6 U. S. T., at 3318, 3320
(emphasis added). As its terms make clear, Common Article 3 is only
violated, as relevant here, by the act of “passing of sentenc[e],”
and thus Hamdan will only have a claim \\if\\ his military commission
convicts him and imposes a sentence. Accordingly, as Hamdan’s claim is
“contingent [upon] future events that may not occur as anticipated,
or indeed may not occur at all,” it is not ripe for adjudication.
\\Texas\\ v. \\United States,\\ 523 U. S. 296, 300 (1998) (internal
quotation marks omitted).[[19]] Indeed, even if we assume he will be
convicted and sentenced, whether his trial will be conducted in a manner
so as to deprive him of “the judicial guarantees which are recognized
as indispensable by civilized peoples” is entirely speculative. And
premature adjudication of Hamdan’s claim is especially inappropriate
here because “reaching the merits of the dispute would force us to
decide whether an action taken by one of the other two branches of the
Federal Government was unconstitutional.” \\Raines\\ v. \\Byrd,\\ 521
U. S. 811, 819–820 (1997).

  In any event, Hamdan’s military commission complies with the
requirements of Common Article 3. It is plainly “regularly
constituted” because such commissions have been employed throughout
our history to try unlawful combatants for crimes against the law of
war. This Court has recounted that history as follows: @@721@@

^19 The Court does not dispute the conclusion that Common Article 3
cannot be violated unless and until Hamdan is convicted and sentenced.
Instead, it contends that “the Geneva Conventions d[o] not direct an
accused to wait until sentence is imposed to challenge the legality of
the tribunal that is to try him.” \\Ante,\\ at 626, n. 55. But the
Geneva Conventions do not direct defendants to enforce their rights
through litigation, but through the Conventions’ exclusive diplomatic
enforcement provisions. Moreover, neither the Court’s observation
respecting the Geneva Conventions nor its reference to the equitable
doctrine of abstention bears on the \\constitutional\\ prohibition on
adjudicating unripe claims.

    “ ‘By a practice dating from 1847 and renewed and firmly
established during the Civil War, military commissions have become
adopted as authorized tribunals in this country in time of war. . . . Their
competency has been recognized not only in acts of Congress, but in
executive proclamations, in rulings of the courts, and in the opinions
of the Attorneys General.’ ” \\Madsen,\\ 343 U. S., at 346, n. 8.

Hamdan’s commission has been constituted in accordance with these
historical precedents. As I have previously explained, the procedures to
be employed by that commission, and the Executive’s authority to alter
those procedures, are consistent with the practice of previous American
military commissions. See \\supra,\\ at 706–712, and n. 15.

  The Court concludes Hamdan’s commission fails to satisfy the
requirements of Common Article 3 not because it differs from the
practice of previous military commissions but because it “deviate[s]
from [the procedures] governing courts-martial.” \\Ante,\\ at 634. But
there is neither a statutory nor historical requirement that military
commissions conform to the structure and practice of courts-martial.
A military commission is a different tribunal, serving a different
function, and thus operates pursuant to different procedures. The
150-year pedigree of the military commission is itself sufficient to
establish that such tribunals are “regularly constituted court[s].”
Art. 3, ¶ 1\\(d),\\ 6 U. S. T., at 3320.

  Similarly, the procedures to be employed by Hamdan’s commission
afford “all the judicial guarantees which are recognized as
indispensable by civilized peoples.” Neither the Court nor petitioner
disputes the Government’s description of those procedures.

    “Petitioner is entitled to appointed military legal counsel, 32
C.F.R. 9.4(c)(2), and may retain a civilian attorney (which he has
done), 32 C.F.R. 9.4(c)(2)(iii)(B). Petitioner is entitled to the
presumption of innocence, 32 @@722@@ C.F.R. 9.5(b), proof beyond a
reasonable doubt, 32 C.F.R. 9.5(c), and the right to remain silent, 32
C.F.R. 9.5(f). He may confront witnesses against him, 32 C.F.R. 9.5(i),
and may subpoena his own witnesses, if reasonably available, 32 C.F.R.
9.5(h). Petitioner may personally be present at every stage of the trial
unless he engages in disruptive conduct or the prosecution introduces
classified or otherwise protected information for which no adequate
substitute is available and whose admission will not deprive him of a
full and fair trial, 32 C.F.R. 9.5(k); Military Commission Order No.
1 (Dep’t of Defense Aug. 31, 2005) § 6(B)(3) and (D)(5)(b). If
petitioner is found guilty, the judgment will be reviewed by a review
panel, the Secretary of Defense, and the President, if he does not
designate the Secretary as the final decisionmaker. 32 C.F.R. 9.6(h).
The final judgment is subject to review in the Court of Appeals for
the District of Columbia Circuit and ultimately in this Court. See DTA
§ 1005(e)(3), 119 Stat. 2743; 28 U. S. C. 1254(1).” Brief for
Respondents 4.

Notwithstanding these provisions, which in my judgment easily satisfy
the nebulous standards of Common Article 3,[[20]] the plurality
concludes that Hamdan’s commission is unlawful because of the
possibility that Hamdan will be barred from proceedings and denied
access to evidence that may be used to convict him. \\Ante,\\ at
633–635. But, under the commissions’ rules, the Government may not
impose such bar or denial on Hamdan if it would render his trial unfair,
@@723@@ a question that is clearly within the scope of the appellate
review contemplated by regulation and statute.

^20 Notably, a prosecutor before the \\Quirin\\ military commission has
described these procedures as “a substantial improvement over those
in effect during World War II,” further observing that “[t]hey go
a long way toward assuring that the trials will be full and fair.”
National Institute of Military Justice, Procedures for Trials by
Military Commissions of Certain Non-United States Citizens in the War
Against Terrorism, p. x (2002) (foreword by Lloyd N. Cutler).

  Moreover, while the Executive is surely not required to offer a
particularized defense of these procedures prior to their application,
the procedures themselves make clear that Hamdan would only be excluded
(other than for disruption) if it were necessary to protect classified
(or classifiable) intelligence, Dept. of Defense, Military Commission
Order No. 1, § 6(B)(3) (Aug. 31, 2005), including the sources and
methods for gathering such intelligence. The Government has explained
that “we want to make sure that these proceedings, which are going
on in the middle of the war, do not interfere with our war effort and
. . . because of the way we would be able to handle interrogations and
intelligence information, may actually assist us in promoting our war
aims.” News Briefing (remarks of Douglas J. Feith, Under Secretary
of Defense for Policy). And this Court has concluded, in the very
context of a threat to reveal our Nation’s intelligence gathering
sources and methods, that “[i]t is ‘obvious and unarguable’
that no governmental interest is more compelling than the security
of the Nation,” \\Haig,\\ 453 U. S., at 307 (quoting \\Aptheker\\
v. \\Secretary of State,\\ 378 U. S. 500, 509 (1964)), and that
“[m]easures to protect the secrecy of our Government’s foreign
intelligence operations plainly serve these interests,” \\Haig,
supra,\\ at 307. See also \\Snepp\\ v. \\United States,\\ 444 U. S.
507, 509, n. 3 (1980) \\(per curiam)\\ (“The Government has a
compelling interest in protecting both the secrecy of information
important to our national security and the appearance of confidentiality
so essential to the effective operation of our foreign intelligence
service”); \\Curtiss-Wright,\\ 299 U. S., at 320. This interest is
surely compelling here. According to the Government, “[b]ecause al
Qaeda operates as a clandestine force relying on sleeper agents to
mount surprise attacks, one of the most critical fronts in the current
war involves gathering intelligence about future terrorist attacks and
how the terrorist network @@724@@ operates—identifying where its
operatives are, how it plans attacks, who directs operations, and how
they communicate.” Brief for United States in No. 03–4792, \\United
States\\ v. \\Moussaoui\\ (CA4), p. 9. We should not rule out the
possibility that this compelling interest can be protected, while at the
same time affording Hamdan (and others like him) a fair trial.

  In these circumstances, “civilized peoples” would take into
account the context of military commission trials against unlawful
combatants in the war on terrorism, including the need to keep certain
information secret in the interest of preventing future attacks on our
Nation and its foreign installations so long as it did not deprive the
accused of a fair trial. Accordingly, the President’s understanding of
the requirements of Common Article 3 is entitled to “great weight.”
See \\supra,\\ at 718.

### 4

  In addition to Common Article 3, which applies to conflicts “not of
an international character,” Hamdan also claims that he is entitled
to the protections of the Third Geneva Convention, which applies to
conflicts between two or more High Contracting Parties. There is no
merit to Hamdan’s claim.

  Article 2 of the Convention provides that “the present Convention
shall apply to all cases of declared war or of any other armed conflict
which may arise between two or more of the High Contracting Parties.”
6 U. S. T., at 3318. “Pursuant to [his] authority as Commander in
Chief and Chief Executive of the United States,” the President has
determined that the Convention is inapplicable here, explaining that
“none of the provisions of Geneva apply to our conflict with al Qaeda
in Afghanistan or elsewhere throughout the world because, among other
reasons, al Qaeda is not a High Contracting Party.” App. 35. The
President’s findings about the nature of the present conflict with
respect to members of al Qaeda operating in Afghanistan represents a
core @@725@@ exercise of his Commander in Chief authority that this
Court is bound to respect. See \\Prize Cases,\\ 2 Black, at 670.

  For these reasons, I would affirm the judgment of the Court of
Appeals.
