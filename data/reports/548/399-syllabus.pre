The 1990 census resulted in a 3-seat increase over the 27 seats
previously allotted the Texas congressional delegation. Although the
Democratic Party then controlled 19 of those 27 seats, as well as both
state legislative houses and the governorship, change was in the air:
The Republican Party had received 47% of the 1990 statewide vote, while
the Democrats had received only 51%. Faced with a possible Republican
ascent to majority status, the legislature drew a congressional
redistricting plan that favored Democratic candidates. The Republicans
challenged the 1991 plan as an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander,
but to no avail.

The 2000 census authorized two additional seats for the Texas
delegation. The Republicans then controlled the governorship and
the State Senate, but did not yet control the State House of
Representatives. So constituted, the legislature was unable to pass
a redistricting scheme, resulting in litigation and the necessity
of a court-ordered plan to comply with the U. S. Constitution’s
one-person, one-vote requirement. Conscious that the primary
responsibility for drawing congressional districts lies with the
political branches of government, and hesitant to undo the work of one
political party for the benefit of another, the three-judge Federal
District Court sought to apply only “neutral” redistricting
standards when drawing Plan 1151C, including placing the two new seats
in high-growth areas, following county and voting precinct lines,
and avoiding the pairing of incumbents. Under Plan 1151C, the 2002
congressional elections resulted in a 17-to-15 Democratic majority in
the Texas delegation, compared to a 59% to 40% Republican majority in
votes for statewide office in 2000, thus leaving the 1991 Democratic
gerrymander largely in place.

In 2003, however, Texas Republicans gained control of both houses of
the legislature and set out to increase Republican representation in
the congressional delegation. After a protracted partisan struggle,
the leg@@400@@islature enacted a new congressional districting map,
Plan 1374C. In the 2004 congressional elections, Republicans won 21
seats to the Democrats’ 11, while also obtaining 58% of the vote in
statewide races against the Democrats’ 41%. Soon after Plan 1374C
was enacted, appellants challenged it in court, alleging a host of
constitutional and statutory violations. In 2004 the District Court
entered judgment for appellees, but this Court vacated the decision and
remanded for consideration in light of \\Vieth\\ v. \\Jubelirer,\\ 541
U. S. 267. On remand, the District Court, believing the scope of its
mandate was limited to questions of political gerrymandering, again
rejected appellants’ claims. \\Held:\\ The judgment is affirmed in
part, reversed in part, and vacated in part, and the cases are remanded.
399 F. Supp. 2d 756, affirmed in part, reversed in part, vacated in
part, and remanded.

<<Justice Kennedy>> delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to
Parts II–A and III, concluding:

1. This Court held, in \\Davis\\ v. \\Bandemer,\\ 478 U. S. 109,
118–127, that an equal protection challenge to a political gerrymander
presents a justiciable case or controversy, although it could not agree
on what substantive standard to apply, compare \\id.,\\ at 127–137,
with \\id.,\\ at 161–162. That disagreement persists. The \\Vieth\\
plurality would have held such challenges nonjusticiable political
questions, but a majority declined to do so, see 541 U. S., at 306,
317, 343, 355. Justiciability is not revisited here. At issue is
whether appellants offer a manageable, reliable measure of fairness for
determining whether a partisan gerrymander is unconstitutional. Pp.
413–414.

2. Texas’ redrawing of District 23’s lines amounts to vote dilution
violative of §2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Pp. 423–443.

(a) Plan 1374C’s changes to District 23 served the dual goals of
increasing Republican seats and protecting the incumbent Republican
against an increasingly powerful Latino population that threatened
to oust him, with the additional political nuance that he would be
reelected in a district that had a Latino majority as to voting-age
population, though not a Latino majority as to citizen voting-age
population or an effective Latino voting majority. The District
23 changes required adjustments elsewhere, so the State created
new District 25 to avoid retrogression under § 5 of the Act. Pp.
423–425.

(b) A State violates § 2 “if, based on the totality of
circumstances, it is shown that the political processes leading to
nomination or election . . . are not [as] equally open to . . . members
of [a racial group as they are to] other members of the electorate.”
42 U. S. C. § 1973(b). \\Thornburg\\ v. \\Gingles,\\ 478 U. S. 30,
50–51, identified three threshold con@@401@@ditions for establishing
a § 2 violation: (1) the racial group must be “sufficiently large
and geographically compact to constitute a majority in a single-member
district”; (2) the group must be “politically cohesive”; and (3)
the white majority must “vot[e] sufficiently as a bloc to enable
it . . . usually to defeat the minority’s preferred candidate.”
The legislative history identifies factors that courts can use, once
all three threshold requirements are met, in interpreting § 2’s
“totality of circumstances” standard, including the State’s
history of voting-related discrimination, the extent to which voting
is racially polarized, and the extent to which the State has used
voting practices or procedures that tend to enhance the opportunity for
discrimination against the minority group. See \\id.,\\ at 44–45.
Another relevant consideration is whether the number of districts
in which the minority group forms an effective majority is roughly
proportional to its share of the population in the relevant area.
\\Johnson\\ v. \\De Grandy,\\ 512 U. S. 997, 1000. The district
court’s determination whether the § 2 requirements are satisfied
must be upheld unless clearly erroneous. See \\Gingles, supra,\\ at
78–79. Where “the ultimate finding of dilution” is based on “a
misreading of the governing law,” however, there is reversible error.
\\De Grandy, supra,\\ at 1022. Pp. 425–427.

(c) Appellants have satisfied all three \\Gingles\\ requirements as to
District 23, and the creation of new District 25 does not remedy the
problem.

The second and third \\Gingles\\ factors—Latino cohesion, majority
bloc voting—are present, given the District Court’s finding of
racially polarized voting in District 23 and throughout the State. As
to the first \\Gingles\\ precondition—that the minority group be
large and compact enough to constitute a majority in a single-member
district, 478 U. S., at 50—appellants have established that Latinos
could have had an opportunity district in District 23 had its lines
not been altered and that they do not have one now. They constituted
a majority of the citizen voting-age population in District 23 under
Plan 1151C. The District Court suggested incorrectly that the district
was not a Latino opportunity district in 2002 simply because the
incumbent prevailed. The fact that a group does not win elections does
not resolve the vote dilution issue. \\De Grandy,\\ 512 U. S., at 1014,
n. 11. In old District 23 the increase in Latino voter registration
and overall population, the concomitant rise in Latino voting power in
each successive election, the near victory of the Latino candidate of
choice in 2002, and the resulting threat to the incumbent’s continued
election were the very reasons the State redrew the district lines.
Since the redistricting prevented the immediate success of the emergent
Latino majority in District 23, there was a denial of opportunity in
the real sense of that term. Plan 1374C’s @@402@@ version of District
23, by contrast, is unquestionably not a Latino opportunity district.
That Latinos are now a bare majority of the district’s voting-age
population is not dispositive, since the relevant numbers must account
for citizenship in order to determine the group’s opportunity to elect
candidates, and Latinos do not now have a citizen votingage majority in
the district.

The State’s argument that it met its § 2 obligations by creating
new District 25 as an offsetting opportunity district is rejected. In
a district line-drawing challenge, “the first \\Gingles\\ condition
requires the possibility of creating more than the existing number
of reasonably compact districts with a sufficiently large minority
population to elect candidates of its choice.” \\Id.,\\ at 1008. The
District Court’s finding that the current plan contains six Latino
opportunity districts and that seven reasonably compact districts, as
proposed by appellant GI Forum, could not be drawn was not clearly
erroneous. However, the court failed to perform the required compactness
inquiry between the number of Latino opportunity districts under the
challenger’s proposal of reinstating Plan 1151C and the “existing
number of reasonably compact districts.” \\Ibid.\\ Section 2 does
not forbid the creation of a noncompact majority-minority district,
\\Bush\\ v. \\Vera,\\ 517 U. S. 952, 999, but such a district cannot
remedy a violation elsewhere in the State, see \\Shaw\\ v. \\Hunt,\\ 517
U. S. 899, 916. The lower court recognized there was a 300-mile gap
between the two Latino communities in District 25, and a similarly large
gap between the needs and interests of the two groups. The court’s
conclusion that the relative smoothness of the district lines made
the district compact, despite this combining of discrete communities
of interest, is inapposite because the court analyzed the issue only
in the equal protection context, where compactness focuses on the
contours of district lines to determine whether race was the predominant
factor in drawing those lines. See \\Miller\\ v. \\Johnson,\\ 515
U. S. 900, 916–917. Under § 2, by contrast, the injury is vote
dilution, so the compactness inquiry considers “the compactness
of the minority population, not. . . the compactness of the contested
district.” \\Vera,\\ 517 U. S., at 997. A district that “reaches
out to grab small and apparently isolated minority communities” is
not reasonably compact. \\Id.,\\ at 979. The lower court’s findings
regarding the different characteristics, needs, and interests of the two
widely scattered Latino communities in District 23 are well supported
and uncontested. The enormous geographical distances separating the two
communities, coupled with the disparate needs and interests of these
populations—not either factor alone—renders District 25 noncompact
for § 2 purposes. Therefore, Plan 1374C contains only five reasonably
compact Latino opportunity districts, one fewer than Plan 1151C. Pp.
427–435. @@403@@

(d) The totality of the circumstances demonstrates a § 2 violation.
The relevant proportionality inquiry, see \\De Grandy,\\ 512 U. S.,
at 1000, compares the percentage of total districts that are Latino
opportunity districts with the Latino share of the citizen voting-age
population. The State’s contention that proportionality should be
decided on a regional basis is rejected in favor of appellants’
assertion that their claim requires a statewide analysis because
they have alleged statewide vote dilution based on a statewide plan.
Looking statewide, there are 32 congressional districts. The five
reasonably compact Latino opportunity districts amount to roughly 16%
of the total, while Latinos make up 22% of Texas’ citizen voting-age
population. Latinos are, therefore, two districts shy of proportional
representation. Even deeming this disproportionality insubstantial
would not overcome the other evidence of vote dilution for Latinos in
District 23. The changes there undermined the progress of a racial group
that has been subject to significant voting-related discrimination
and that was becoming increasingly politically active and cohesive.
Cf., \\e. g., id.,\\ at 1014. Against this background, the Latinos’
diminishing electoral support for the incumbent indicates their belief
he was unresponsive to their particularized needs. In essence, the
State took away their opportunity because they were about to exercise
it. Even accepting the District Court’s finding that the State’s
action was taken primarily for political, not racial, reasons, the
redrawing of District 23’s lines was damaging to its Latino voters.
The State not only made fruitless the Latinos’ mobilization efforts
but also acted against those Latinos who were becoming most politically
active. Although incumbency protection can be a legitimate factor in
districting, see \\Karcher\\ v. \\Daggett,\\ 462 U. S. 725, 740, not
all of its forms are in the interests of the constituents. If, as here,
such protection means excluding some voters from the district simply
because they are likely to vote against the officeholder, the change is
to benefit the officeholder, not the voters. This policy, whatever its
validity in the political realm, cannot justify the effect on Latino
voters. See \\Gingles, supra,\\ at 45. Pp. 436–442.

(e) Because Plan 1374C violates § 2 in its redrawing of District 23,
appellants’ First Amendment and equal protection claims with respect
to that district need not be addressed. Their equal protection claim
as to the drawing of District 25 need not be confronted because that
district will have to be redrawn to remedy the District 23 violation.
Pp. 442–443.

<<Justice Kennedy>> concluded in Part II that because appellants have
established no legally impermissible use of political classifications,
they state no claim on which relief may be granted as to their
contention that Texas’ statewide redistricting is an unconstitutional
political gerry@@404@@mander. <<Justice Souter>> and <<Justice
Ginsburg>> joined Part <<II–D.>> Pp. 414–423.

(a) Article I of the Constitution, §§ 2 and 4, gives “the States
primary responsibility for apportionment of their . . . congressional
. . . districts,” \\Growe\\ v. \\Emison,\\ 507 U. S. 25, 34, but
§ 4 also permits Congress to set further requirements. Neither
the Constitution nor Congress has stated any explicit prohibition
of mid-decade redistricting to change districts drawn earlier in
conformance with a decennial census. Although the legislative branch
plays the primary role in congressional redistricting, courts have an
important role when a districting plan violates the Constitution. See,
\\e. g., Wesberry\\ v. \\Sanders,\\ 376 U. S. 1. That the federal
courts sometimes must order legislative redistricting, however, does not
shift the primary responsibility away from legislative bodies, see, \\e.
g., Wise\\ v. \\Lipscomb,\\ 437 U. S. 535, 540, who are free to replace
court-mandated remedial plans by enacting redistricting plans of their
own, see, \\e. g., Upham\\ v. \\Seamon,\\ 456 U. S. 37, 44. Judicial
respect for legislative plans, however, cannot justify legislative
reliance on improper criteria for districting determinations. Pp.
414–416.

(b) Appellants claim unpersuasively that a decision to effect
middecennial redistricting, when solely motivated by partisan
objectives, presumptively violates equal protection and the First
Amendment because it serves no legitimate public purpose and burdens one
group because of its political opinions and affiliation. For a number of
reasons, that test is unconvincing. There is some merit to the State’s
assertion that partisan gain was not the sole motivation for replacing
Plan 1151C: The contours of some contested district lines seem to have
been drawn based on more mundane and local interests, and a number of
line-drawing requests by Democratic state legislators were honored.
Moreover, a successful test for identifying unconstitutional partisan
gerrymandering must do what appellants’ sole-motivation theory
explicitly disavows: show a burden, as measured by a reliable standard,
on the complainants’ representational rights. See \\Vieth,\\ 541 U.
S., at 292–295, 307–308. Appellants’ sole-intent standard is no
more compelling when it is linked to the circumstance that Plan 1374C
is mid-decennial legislation. The Constitution’s text and structure
and this Court’s cases indicate there is nothing inherently suspect
about a legislature’s decision to replace mid-decade a court-ordered
plan with one of its own. Even if there were, the fact of mid-decade
redistricting alone is no sure indication of unlawful political
gerrymanders. Appellants’ test would leave untouched the 1991 Texas
redistricting, which entrenched a party on the verge of minority status,
while striking down the 2003 redistricting plan, which resulted in the
majority Republican Party capturing a larger share of the seats. A test
that treats these two similarly effective @@405@@ power plays in such
different ways does not have the reliability appellants ascribe to it.
Pp. 416–420.

(c) Appellants’ political gerrymandering theory that mid-decade
redistricting for exclusively partisan purposes violates the
one-person, one-vote requirement is rejected. Although conceding
that States operate under the legal fiction that their plans are
constitutionally apportioned throughout a decade, see, \\e. g.,
Georgia\\ v. \\Ashcroft,\\ 539 U. S. 461, 488, n. 2, appellants contend
that this fiction should not provide a safe harbor for a legislature
that enacts a voluntary, mid-decade plan overriding a legal court-drawn
plan. This argument mirrors appellants’ attack on mid-decennial
redistricting solely motivated by partisan considerations and is
unsatisfactory for the same reasons. Their further contention that the
legislature intentionally sought to manipulate population variances when
it enacted Plan 1374C is unconvincing because there is no District Court
finding to that effect, and they present no specific evidence to support
this serious allegation of bad faith. Because they have not demonstrated
that the legislature’s decision to enact Plan 1374C constitutes a
violation of the equal-population requirement, their subsidiary reliance
on \\Larios\\ v. \\Cox,\\ 300 F. Supp. 2d 1320, summarily aff’d, 542
U. S. 947, is unavailing. Pp. 420–423.

<<Justice Kennedy,>> joined by <<The Chief Justice>> and <<Justice
Alito,>> concluded in Part IV that the Dallas area redistricting does
not violate § 2 of the Voting Rights Act. Appellants allege that
the Dallas changes dilute African-American voting strength because an
African- American minority effectively controlled District 24 under Plan
1151C. However, before Plan 1374C, District 24 had elected an Anglo
Democrat to Congress in every election since 1978. Since then, moreover,
the incumbent has had no opposition in any of his primary elections, and
African-Americans have consistently voted for him. African- Americans
were the second-largest racial group in the district after Anglos, but
had only 25.7% of the citizen voting-age population. Even assuming that
the first \\Gingles\\ prong can accommodate appellants’ assertion that
a § 2 claim may be stated for a racial group that makes up less than
50% of the population, see, \\e. g., De Grandy, supra,\\ at 1009, they
must show they constitute “a sufficiently large minority to elect
their candidate of choice with the assistance of cross-over votes,”
\\Voinovich\\ v. \\Quilter,\\ 507 U. S. 146, 158. The District Court
committed no clear error in rejecting questionable evidence that
African-Americans have the ability to elect their candidate of choice
in favor of other evidence that an African-American candidate of choice
would not prevail. See \\Anderson\\ v. \\Bessemer City,\\ 470 U. S.
564, 574. That African- Americans had influence in the district does not
suffice to state a § 2 claim. If it did, it would unnecessarily infuse
race into virtually every redistricting, raising serious constitutional
questions. See \\Georgia\\ v. @@406@@ \\Ashcroft,\\ 539 U. S. 461,
491. \\Id.,\\ at 480, 482, distinguished. Appellants do not raise a
district-specific political gerrymandering claim against District 24.
Pp. 443–447.

<<The Chief Justice,>> joined by <<Justice Alito,>> agreed that
appellants have not provided a reliable standard for identifying
unconstitutional political gerrymanders, but noted that the question
whether any such standard exists—\\i. e.,\\ whether a challenge to
such a gerrymander presents a justiciable case or controversy—has
not been argued in these cases. <<The Chief Justice>> and <<Justice
Alito>> therefore take no position on that question, which has divided
the Court, see \\Vieth\\ v. \\Jubelirer,\\ 541 U. S. 267, and join the
plurality’s Part II disposition without specifying whether appellants
have failed to state a claim on which relief can be granted or failed to
present a justiciable controversy. Pp. 492–493.

<<Justice Scalia,>> joined by <<Justice Thomas,>> concluded that
appellants’ claims of unconstitutional political gerrymandering
do not present a justiciable case or controversy, see \\Vieth\\ v.
\\Jubelirer,\\ 541 U. S. 267, 271–306 (plurality opinion), and that
their vote-dilution claims premised on § 2 of the Voting Rights Act
of 1965 lack merit for the reasons set forth in <<Justice Thomas’>>s
opinion concurring in the judgment in \\Holder\\ v. \\Hall,\\ 512 U. S.
874, 891–946. Reviewing appellants’ race-based equal protection
claims, <<Justice Scalia,>> joined by <<The Chief Justice, Justice
Thomas,>> and <<Justice Alito,>> concluded that the District Court did
not commit clear error in rejecting appellant GI Forum’s assertion
that the removal of Latino residents from District 23 constituted
intentional vote dilution. <<Justice Scalia,>> joined by <<The Chief
Justice, Justice Thomas,>> and <<Justice Alito,>> subjected the
intentional creation of District 25 as a majority-minority district to
strict scrutiny and held that standard satisfied because appellants
conceded that the creation of this district was reasonably necessary
to comply with § 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which is a
compelling state interest, and did not argue that Texas did more than
that provision required it to do. Pp. 512–520. <<Kennedy,>> J.,
