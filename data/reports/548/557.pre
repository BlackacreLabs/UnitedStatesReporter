  <<Justice Stevens>> announced the judgment of the Court and delivered
the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I through IV, Parts VI
through VI–D–iii, Part VI–D–v, and Part VII, and an opinion with
respect to Parts V and VI–D–iv, in which <<Justice Souter, Justice
Ginsburg,>> and <<Justice Breyer>> join.

  Petitioner Salim Ahmed Hamdan, a Yemeni national, is in custody at
  an American prison in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. In November 2001, during
  hostilities between the United States and the Taliban (which then
  governed Afghanistan), Hamdan was captured by militia forces and
  turned over to the U. S. military. In June 2002, he was transported
  to Guantanamo Bay. Over a year later, the President deemed him
  eligible for trial by military commission for then-unspecified
  crimes. After another year had passed, Hamdan was charged with one
  count of conspiracy “to commit . . . offenses triable by military
  commission.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 65a. @@567@@

  Hamdan filed petitions for writs of habeas corpus and mandamus to
challenge the Executive Branch’s intended means of prosecuting this
charge. He concedes that a courtmartial constituted in accordance
with the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), 10 U. S. C. §801
\\et seq.\\ (2000 ed. and Supp. III), would have authority to try
him. His objection is that the military commission the President has
convened lacks such authority, for two principal reasons: First, neither
congressional Act nor the common law of war supports trial by this
commission for the crime of conspiracy— an offense that, Hamdan says,
is not a violation of the law of war. Second, Hamdan contends, the
procedures that the President has adopted to try him violate the most
basic tenets of military and international law, including the principle
that a defendant must be permitted to see and hear the evidence against
him.

  The District Court granted Hamdan’s request for a writ of habeas
corpus. 344 F. Supp. 2d 152 (DC 2004). The Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia Circuit reversed. 415 F. 3d 33 (2005). Recognizing,
as we did over a half century ago, that trial by military commission is
an extraordinary measure raising important questions about the balance
of powers in our constitutional structure, \\Ex parte Quirin,\\ 317
U. S. 1, 19 (1942), we granted certiorari. 546 U. S. 1002 (2005).

  For the reasons that follow, we conclude that the military commission
convened to try Hamdan lacks power to proceed because its structure and
procedures violate both the UCMJ and the Geneva Conventions. Four of us
also conclude, see Part V, \\infra,\\ that the offense with which Hamdan
has been charged is not an “offens[e] that by . . . the law of war may
be tried by military commissions.” 10 U. S. C. § 821.

  On September 11, 2001, agents of the al Qaeda terrorist organization
hijacked commercial airplanes and attacked the @@568@@ World Trade
Center in New York City and the national headquarters of the Department
of Defense in Arlington, Virginia. Americans will never forget the
devastation wrought by these acts. Nearly 3,000 civilians were killed.

  Congress responded by adopting a Joint Resolution authorizing the
President to “use all necessary and appropriate force against those
nations, organizations, or persons he determines planned, authorized,
committed, or aided the terrorist attacks . . . in order to prevent any
future acts of international terrorism against the United States by such
nations, organizations or persons.” Authorization for Use of Military
Force (AUMF), 115 Stat. 224, note following 50 U. S. C. § 1541 (2000
ed., Supp. III). Acting pursuant to the AUMF, and having determined that
the Taliban regime had supported al Qaeda, the President ordered the
Armed Forces of the United States to invade Afghanistan. In the ensuing
hostilities, hundreds of individuals, Hamdan among them, were captured
and eventually detained at Guantanamo Bay.

  On November 13, 2001, while the United States was still engaged in
active combat with the Taliban, the President issued a comprehensive
military order intended to govern the “Detention, Treatment, and
Trial of Certain Non- Citizens in the War Against Terrorism,” 66 Fed.
Reg. 57833 (hereinafter November 13 Order or Order). Those subject to
the November 13 Order include any noncitizen for whom the President
determines “there is reason to believe” that he or she (1) “is
or was” a member of al Qaeda or (2) has engaged or participated in
terrorist activities aimed at or harmful to the United States. \\Id.,\\
at 57834. Any such individual “shall, when tried, be tried by military
commission for any and all offenses triable by military commission that
such individual is alleged to have committed, and may be punished in
accordance with the penalties provided under applicable law, including
life imprisonment or death.” \\Ibid.\\ The No@@569@@vember 13 Order
vested in the Secretary of Defense the power to appoint military
commissions to try individuals subject to the Order, but that power
has since been delegated to John D. Altenburg, Jr., a retired Army
major general and longtime military lawyer who has been designated
“Appointing Authority for Military Commissions.”

  On July 3, 2003, the President announced his determination that Hamdan
and five other detainees at Guantanamo Bay were subject to the November
13 Order and thus triable by military commission. In December 2003,
military counsel was appointed to represent Hamdan. Two months later,
counsel filed demands for charges and for a speedy trial pursuant to
Article 10 of the UCMJ, 10 U. S. C. §810. On February 23, 2004, the
legal adviser to the Appointing Authority denied the applications,
ruling that Hamdan was not entitled to any of the protections of the
UCMJ. Not until July 13, 2004, after Hamdan had commenced this action in
the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington,
did the Government finally charge him with the offense for which, a year
earlier, he had been deemed eligible for trial by military commission.

  The charging document, which is unsigned, contains 13 numbered
paragraphs. The first two paragraphs recite the asserted bases for the
military commission’s jurisdiction— namely, the November 13 Order
and the President’s July 3, 2003, declaration that Hamdan is eligible
for trial by military commission. The next nine paragraphs, collectively
entitled “General Allegations,” describe al Qaeda’s activities
from its inception in 1989 through 2001 and identify Usama bin Laden as
the group’s leader. Hamdan is not mentioned in these paragraphs.

  Only the final two paragraphs, entitled “Charge: Conspiracy,”
contain allegations against Hamdan. Paragraph 12 charges that “from
on or about February 1996 to on or about November 24, 2001,” Hamdan
“willfully and knowingly @@570@@ joined an enterprise of persons
who shared a common criminal purpose and conspired and agreed with
[named members of al Qaeda] to commit the following offenses triable by
military commission: attacking civilians; attacking civilian objects;
murder by an unprivileged belligerent; and terrorism.” App. to Pet.
for Cert. 65a. There is no allegation that Hamdan had any command
responsibilities, played a leadership role, or participated in the
planning of any activity.

  Paragraph 13 lists four “overt acts” that Hamdan is alleged to
have committed sometime between 1996 and November 2001 in furtherance of
the “enterprise and conspiracy”: (1) he acted as Usama bin Laden’s
“bodyguard and personal driver,” “believ[ing]” all the while
that bin Laden “and his associates were involved in” terrorist
acts prior to and including the attacks of September 11, 2001; (2)
he arranged for transportation of, and actually transported, weapons
used by al Qaeda members and by bin Laden’s bodyguards (Hamdan among
them); (3) he “drove or accompanied [U]sama bin Laden to various al
Qaida-sponsored training camps, press conferences, or lectures,”
at which bin Laden encouraged attacks against Americans; and (4) he
received weapons training at al Qaeda-sponsored camps. \\Id.,\\ at
65a–67a.

  After this formal charge was filed, the United States District Court
for the Western District of Washington transerred Hamdan’s habeas and
mandamus petitions to the United States District Court for the District
of Columbia. Meanwhile, a Combatant Status Review Tribunal (CSRT)
convened pursuant to a military order issued on July 7, 2004, decided
that Hamdan’s continued detention at Guantanamo Bay was warranted
because he was an “enemy combatant.”[[1]] @@571@@ Separately,
proceedings before the military commission commenced.

^1 An “enemy combatant” is defined by the military order as “an
individual who was part of or supporting Taliban or al Qaeda forces,
or associated forces that are engaged in hostilities against the
United States or its coalition partners.” Memorandum from Deputy
Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz re: Order Establishing Combatant
Status Review Tribunal @@571@@ § \\a\\ (July 7, 2004), available
at http://www.defenselink.mil/news/Jul2004/d20040707review.pdf (all
Internet materials as visited June 26, 2006, and available in Clerk of
Court’s case file).

  On November 8, 2004, however, the District Court granted Hamdan’s
petition for habeas corpus and stayed the commission’s proceedings.
It concluded that the President’s authority to establish military
commissions extends only to “offenders or offenses triable by military
[commission] under the law of war,” 344 F. Supp. 2d, at 158; that
the law of war includes the Geneva Convention (III) Relative to the
Treatment of Prisoners of War, Aug. 12, 1949, [1955] 6 U. S. T. 3316,
T. I. A. S. No. 3364 (Third Geneva Convention); that Hamdan is entitled
to the full protections of the Third Geneva Convention until adjudged,
in compliance with that treaty, not to be a prisoner of war; and that,
whether or not Hamdan is properly classified as a prisoner of war, the
military commission convened to try him was established in violation
of both the UCMJ and Common Article 3 of the Third Geneva Convention
because it had the power to convict based on evidence the accused would
never see or hear. 344 F. Supp. 2d, at 158–172.

  The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit
reversed. Like the District Court, the Court of Appeals declined the
Government’s invitation to abstain from considering Hamdan’s
challenge. Cf. \\Schlesinger\\ v. \\Councilman,\\ 420 U. S. 738 (1975).
On the merits, the panel rejected the District Court’s further
conclusion that Hamdan was entitled to relief under the Third Geneva
Convention. All three judges agreed that the Geneva Conventions were not
“judicially enforceable,” 415 F. 3d, at 38, and two thought that the
Conventions did not in any event apply to Hamdan, \\id.,\\ at 40–42;
but see \\id.,\\ at 44 (Williams, J., concurring). In other portions
of its opinion, the court concluded that our decision in \\Quirin\\
foreclosed any separation-of-powers objection to @@572@@ the military
commission’s jurisdiction, and held that Hamdan’s trial before the
contemplated commission would violate neither the UCMJ nor U. S. Armed
Forces regulations intended to implement the Geneva Conventions. 415 F.
3d, at 38, 42–43.

  On November 7, 2005, we granted certiorari to decide whether the
military commission convened to try Hamdan has authority to do so, and
whether Hamdan may rely on the Geneva Conventions in these proceedings.

# II

  On February 13, 2006, the Government filed a motion to dismiss the
writ of certiorari. The ground cited for dismissal was the recently
enacted Detainee Treatment Act of 2005 (DTA), Pub. L. 109–148, 119
Stat. 2739. We postponed our ruling on that motion pending argument on
the merits, 546 U. S. 1166 (2006), and now deny it.

  The DTA, which was signed into law on December 30, 2005, addresses a
broad swath of subjects related to detainees. It places restrictions
on the treatment and interrogation of detainees in U. S. custody, and
it furnishes procedural protections for U. S. personnel accused of
engaging in improper interrogation. DTA §§ 1002–1004, 119 Stat.
2739–2740. It also sets forth certain “<<procedures for status
review of detainees outside the United States.>>” § 1005, \\id.,\\
at 2740. Subsections (a) through (d) of § 1005 direct the Secretary
of Defense to report to Congress the procedures being used by CSRTs to
determine the proper classification of detainees held in Guantanamo Bay,
Iraq, and Afghanistan, and to adopt certain safeguards as part of those
procedures.

  Subsection (e) of § 1005, which is entitled “<<Judicial Review
of Detention of Enemy Combatants,>>” supplies the basis for the
Government’s jurisdictional argument. The subsection contains three
numbered paragraphs. The first paragraph amends the judicial code as
follows: @@573@@

      “(1) <<In general.>>—Section 2241 of title 28, United States
Code, is amended by adding at the end the following:

      “ ‘(e) Except as provided in section 1005 of the Detainee
Treatment Act of 2005, no court, justice, or judge shall have
jurisdiction to hear or consider—

      “ ‘(1) an application for a writ of habeas corpus filed by
or on behalf of an alien detained by the Department of Defense at
Guantanamo Bay, Cuba; or

      “ ‘(2) any other action against the United States or its
agents relating to any aspect of the detention by the Department of
Defense of an alien at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, who—

      “ ‘(A) is currently in military custody; or

      “ ‘(B) has been determined by the United States Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in accordance with the
procedures set forth in section 1005(e) of the Detainee Treatment Act
of 2005 to have been properly detained as an enemy combatant.’ ”
§ 1005(e), \\id.,\\ at 2741–2742.

  Paragraph (2) of subsection (e) vests in the Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia Circuit the “exclusive jurisdiction to determine
the validity of any final decision of a [CSRT] that an alien is properly
detained as an enemy combatant.” Paragraph (2) also delimits the scope
of that review. See §§ 1005(e)(2)(C)(i)–(ii), \\id.,\\ at 2742.

  Paragraph (3) mirrors paragraph (2) in structure, but governs judicial
review of final decisions of military commissions, not CSRTs. It
vests in the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit
“exclusive jurisdiction to determine the validity of any final
decision rendered pursuant to Military Commission Order No. 1, dated
August 31, 2005 (or any successor military order).” § 1005(e)(3)(A),
\\id.,\\ at 2743.[[2]] @@574@@ Review is as of right for any alien
sentenced to death or a term of imprisonment of 10 years or more, but is
at the Court of Appeals’ discretion in all other cases. The scope of
review is limited to the following inquiries:

^2 The military order referenced in this section is discussed further in
Parts III and VI, \\infra.\\

      “(i) whether the final decision [of the military commission] was
consistent with the standards and procedures specified in the military
order referred to in subparagraph (A); and

      “(ii) to the extent the Constitution and laws of the United
States are applicable, whether the use of such standards and procedures
to reach the final decision is consistent with the Constitution and laws
of the United States.” § 1005(e)(3)(D), \\ibid.\\

  Finally, §1005 contains an “effective date” provision, which
reads as follows:

      “(1) <<In general.>>—This section shall take effect on the
date of the enactment of this Act.

      “(2) <<Review of Combatant Status Tribunal and Military
Commission Decisions.>>—Paragraphs (2) and (3) of subsection (e) shall
apply with respect to any claim whose review is governed by one of such
paragraphs and that is pending on or after the date of the enactment of
this Act.” § 1005(h), \\id.,\\ at 2743–2744.[[3]]

The DTA is silent about whether paragraph (1) of subsection (e) “shall
apply” to claims pending on the date of enactment.

  The Government argues that §§ 1005(e)(1) and 1005(h) had the
immediate effect, upon enactment, of repealing federal jurisdiction not
just over detainee habeas actions yet to be filed but also over any
such actions then pending in any federal court—including this Court.
Accordingly, it argues, we @@575@@ lack jurisdiction to review the Court
of Appeals’ decision below.

^3 The penultimate subsections of § 1005 emphasize that the provision
does not “confer any constitutional right on an alien detained as an
enemy combatant outside the United States” and that the “United
States” does not, for purposes of §1005, include Guantanamo Bay.
§§1005(f)–(g).

  Hamdan objects to this theory on both constitutional and statutory
grounds. Principal among his constitutional arguments is that the
Government’s preferred reading raises grave questions about
Congress’ authority to impinge upon this Court’s appellate
jurisdiction, particularly in habeas cases. Support for this argument
is drawn from \\Ex parte Yerger,\\ 8 Wall. 85 (1869), in which, having
explained that “the denial to this court of appellate jurisdiction”
to consider an original writ of habeas corpus would “greatly weaken
the efficacy of the writ,” \\id.,\\ at 102–103, we held that
Congress would not be presumed to have effected such denial absent an
unmistakably clear statement to the contrary. See \\id.,\\ at 104–105;
see also \\Felker\\ v. \\Turpin,\\ 518 U. S. 651 (1996); \\Durousseau\\
v. \\United States,\\ 6 Cranch 307, 314 (1810) (opinion for the Court
by Marshall, C. J.) (The “appellate powers of this court” are not
created by statute but are “given by the constitution”); \\United
States\\ v. \\Klein,\\ 13 Wall. 128 (1872). Cf. \\Ex parte McCardle,\\
7 Wall. 506, 514 (1869) (holding that Congress had validly foreclosed
one avenue of appellate review where its repeal of habeas jurisdiction,
reproduced in the margin,[[4]] could not have been “a plainer
instance of positive exception”). Hamdan also suggests that, if the
Government’s reading is correct, Congress has unconstitutionally
suspended the writ of habeas corpus.

  We find it unnecessary to reach either of these arguments. Ordinary
principles of statutory construction suffice to rebut @@576@@ the
Government’s theory—at least insofar as this case, which was pending
at the time the DTA was enacted, is concerned.

^4 “‘\\And be it further enacted,\\ That so much of the act approved
February 5, 1867, entitled “An act to amend an act to establish the
judicial courts of the United States, approved September 24, 1789,”
as authorized an appeal from the judgment of the Circuit Court to
the Supreme Court of the United States, or the exercise of any such
jurisdiction by said Supreme Court, on appeals which have been, or may
hereafter be taken, be, and the same is hereby repealed.’ ” 7 Wall.,
at 508.

  The Government acknowledges that only paragraphs (2) and (3) of
subsection (e) are expressly made applicable to pending cases, see
§ 1005(h)(2), 119 Stat. 2743–2744, but argues that the omission of
paragraph (1) from the scope of that express statement is of no moment.
This is so, we are told, because Congress’ failure to expressly
reserve federal courts’ jurisdiction over pending cases erects a
presumption against jurisdiction, and that presumption is rebutted by
neither the text nor the legislative history of the DTA.

  The first part of this argument is not entirely without support
in our precedents. We have in the past “applied intervening
statutes conferring or ousting jurisdiction, whether or not
jurisdiction lay when the underlying conduct occurred or when the
suit was filed.” \\Landgraf\\ v. \\USI Film Products,\\ 511
U. S. 244, 274 (1994) (citing \\Bruner\\ v. \\United States,\\ 343
U. S. 112 (1952); \\Hallowell\\ v. \\Commons,\\ 239 U. S. 506
(1916)); see \\Republic of Austria\\ v. \\Altmann,\\ 541 U. S.
677, 693 (2004). But the “presumption” that these cases have
applied is more accurately viewed as the nonapplication of another
presumption—viz., the presumption against retroactivity—in
certain limited circumstances.[[5]] If a statutory provision “would
operate retroactively” as applied to cases pending at the time the
provision was enacted, then “our traditional presumption teaches
that it does not govern absent clear congressional intent favoring
such a result.” \\Landgraf,\\ 511 U. S., at 280. We have explained,
however, that, unlike other intervening changes in the law, a @@577@@
jurisdiction-conferring or jurisdiction-stripping statute usually
“takes away no substantive right but simply changes the tribunal that
is to hear the case.” \\Hallowell,\\ 239 U. S., at 508. If that is
truly all the statute does, no retroactivity problem arises because the
change in the law does not “impair rights a party possessed when he
acted, increase a party’s liability for past conduct, or impose new
duties with respect to transactions already completed.” \\Landgraf,\\
511 U. S., at 280.[[6]] And if a new rule has no retroactive effect, the
presumption against retroactivity will not prevent its application to a
case that was already pending when the new rule was enacted.

^5 See \\Hughes Aircraft Co.\\ v. \\United States ex rel. Schumer,\\
520 U. S. 939, 951 (1997) (“The fact that courts often apply newly
enacted jurisdiction-allocating statutes to pending cases merely
evidences certain limited circumstances failing to meet the conditions
for our generally applicable presumption against retroactivity. . .”).

  That does not mean, however, that all jurisdiction-stripping
provisions—or even all such provisions that truly lack retroactive
effect—must apply to cases pending at the time of their
enactment.[[7]] “[N]ormal rules of construction,” including a
contextual reading of the statutory language, may dictate otherwise.
\\Lindh\\ v. \\Murphy,\\ 521 U. S. 320, 326 @@578@@ (1997).[[8]] A
familiar principle of statutory construction, relevant both in \\Lindh\\
and here, is that a negative inference may be drawn from the exclusion
of language from one statutory provision that is included in other
provisions of the same statute. See \\id.,\\ at 330; see also, \\e.
g., Russello\\ v. \\United States,\\ 464 U. S. 16, 23 (1983) (“
‘[W]here Congress includes particular language in one section of a
statute but omits it in another section of the same Act, it is generally
presumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate
inclusion or exclusion’ ”). The Court in \\Lindh\\ relied on this
reasoning to conclude that certain limitations on the availability of
habeas relief imposed by AEDPA applied only to cases filed after that
statute’s effective date. Congress’ failure to identify the temporal
reach of those limitations, which governed noncapital cases, stood in
contrast to its express command in the same legislation that new rules
governing habeas petitions in capital cases “apply to cases pending
on or after the date of enactment.” § 107(c), 110 Stat. 1226; see
\\Lindh,\\ 521 U. S., at 329–330. That contrast, combined with the
fact that the amendments at issue “affect[ed] substantive entitlement
to relief,” \\id.,\\ at 327, warranted drawing a negative inference.

^6 Cf. \\ibid.\\ (“Statutes merely addressing \\which\\ court shall
have jurisdiction to entertain a particular cause of action can fairly
be said merely to regulate the secondary conduct of litigation and
not the underlying primary conduct of the parties” (emphasis in
original)).

^7 <<I>>n his insistence to the contrary, <<Justice Scalia>> reads
too much into \\Bruner\\ v. \\United States,\\ 343 U. S. 112 (1952),
\\Hallowell\\ v. \\Commons,\\ 239 U. S. 506 (1916), and \\Insurance
Co.\\ v. \\Ritchie,\\ 5 Wall. 541 (1867). See \\post,\\ at 656–658
(dissenting opinion). None of those cases says that the absence of an
express provision reserving jurisdiction over pending cases trumps
or renders irrelevant any other indications of congressional intent.
Indeed, \\Bruner\\ itself relied on such other indications—including
a negative inference drawn from the statutory text, cf. \\infra,\\ at
578—to support its conclusion that jurisdiction was not available. The
Court observed that (1) Congress had been put on notice by prior lower
court cases addressing the Tucker Act that it ought to specifically
reserve jurisdiction over pending cases, see 343 U. S., at 115, and
(2) in contrast to the congressional silence concerning reservation of
jurisdiction, reservation \\had\\ been made of “ ‘any rights or
liabilities’ existing at the effective date of the Act” repealed by
another provision of the Act, \\ibid.,\\ n. 7.

  A like inference follows \\a fortiori\\ from \\Lindh\\ in this
case. “If . . . Congress was reasonably concerned to ensure that
[§§ 1005(e)(2) and (3)] be applied to pending cases, it should
have been just as concerned about [§ 1005(e)(1)], unless it had
the different intent that the latter [section] not be applied to the
general run of pending cases.” \\Id.,\\ at 329. If anything, the
evidence of deliberate omission is stronger here than it @@579@@
was in \\Lindh.\\ In \\Lindh,\\ the provisions to be contrasted had
been drafted separately but were later “joined together and . . .
considered simultaneously when the language raising the implication
was inserted.” \\Id.,\\ at 330. We observed that Congress’ tandem
review and approval of the two sets of provisions strengthened the
presumption that the relevant omission was deliberate. \\Id.,\\ at
331; see also \\Field\\ v. \\Mans,\\ 516 U. S. 59, 75 (1995) (“The
more apparently deliberate the contrast, the stronger the inference,
as applied, for example, to contrasting statutory sections originally
enacted simultaneously in relevant respects”). Here, Congress not only
considered the respective temporal reaches of paragraphs (1), (2), and
(3) of subsection (e) together at every stage, but omitted paragraph (1)
from its directive that paragraphs (2) and (3) apply to pending cases
only after having \\rejected\\ earlier proposed versions of the statute
that would have included what is now paragraph (1) within the scope of
that directive. Compare DTA § 1005(h)(2), 119 Stat. 2743–2744, with
151 Cong. Rec. S12655 (Nov. 10, 2005) (S. Amdt. 2515); see \\id.,\\ at
S14257–S14258 (Dec. 21, 2005) (discussing similar language proposed
in both the House and the Senate).[[9]] Congress’ rejection of the
very language that would have @@580@@ achieved the result the Government
urges here weighs heavily against the Government’s interpretation. See
\\Doe\\ v. \\Chao,\\ 540 U. S. 614, 621–623 (2004).[[10]] @@581@@

^8 The question in \\Lindh\\ was whether new limitations on the
availability of habeas relief imposed by the Antiterrorism and Effective
Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 110 Stat. 1214, applied to habeas
actions pending on the date of AEDPA’s enactment. We held that they
did not. At the outset, we rejected the State’s argument that, in
the absence of a clear congressional statement to the contrary, a
“procedural” rule must apply to pending cases. 521 U. S., at 326.

^9 That paragraph (1), along with paragraphs (2) and (3), is to “take
effect on the date of the enactment,” DTA §1005(h)(1), 119 Stat.
2743, is not dispositive; “a ‘statement that a statute will become
effective on a certain date does not even arguably suggest that it has
any application to conduct that occurred at an earlier date.’ ”
\\INS\\ v. \\St. Cyr,\\ 533 U. S. 289, 317 (2001) (quoting \\Landgraf\\
v. \\USI Film Products,\\ 511 U. S. 244, 257 (1994)). Certainly, the
“effective date” provision cannot bear the weight <<Justice Scalia>>
would place on it. See \\post,\\ at 659, and n. 1. Congress deemed
that provision insufficient, standing alone, to render subsections
(e)(2) and (e)(3) applicable to pending cases; hence its adoption of
subsection (h)(2). <<Justice Scalia>> seeks to avoid reducing subsection
(h)(2) to a mere redundancy—a consequence he seems to acknowledge
must otherwise follow from his interpretation—by speculating that
Congress had special reasons, not also relevant to subsection (e)(1), to
worry that subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) would be ruled inapplicable to
pending cases. As we explain \\infra,\\ at 582–583, and n. 12, that
attempt fails.

^10 We note that statements made by Senators preceding passage of the
DTA lend further support to what the text of the DTA and its drafting
history already make plain. Senator Levin, one of the sponsors of the
final bill, objected to earlier versions of the DTA’s “effective
date” provision that would have made subsection (e)(1) applicable to
pending cases. See, \\e. g.,\\ 151 Cong. Rec. S12667 (Nov. 10, 2005)
(amendment proposed by Sen. Graham that would have rendered what is
now subsection (e)(1) applicable to “any application or other action
that is pending on or after the date of the enactment of this Act”).
Senator Levin urged adoption of an alternative amendment that “would
apply only to new habeas cases filed after the date of enactment.”
\\Id.,\\ at S12802 (Nov. 15, 2005). That alternative amendment became
the text of subsection (h)(2). (In light of the extensive discussion of
the DTA’s effect on pending cases prior to passage of the DTA, see,
\\e. g., id.,\\ at S12664 (Nov. 10, 2005); \\id.,\\ at S12755 (Nov.

inconsequential. Cf. \\post,\\ at 668 (<<Scalia,>> J., dissenting).)

  ^ While statements attributed to the final bill’s two other
sponsors, Senators Graham and Kyl, arguably contradict Senator Levin’s
contention that the final version of the DTA preserved jurisdiction
over pending habeas cases, see 151 Cong. Rec. S14263–S14264 (Dec.
21, 2005), those statements appear to have been inserted into the
Congressional Record \\after\\ the Senate debate. See Reply Brief for
Petitioner 5, n. 6; see also 151 Cong. Rec. S14260 (statement of Sen.
Kyl) (“I would like to say a few words about the \\now-completed\\
National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2006” (emphasis
added)). All statements made during the debate itself support Senator
Levin’s understanding that the final text of the DTA would not render
subsection (e)(1) applicable to pending cases. See, \\e. g., id.,\\
at S14245, S14252–S14253, S14274–S14275 (Dec. 21, 2005). The
statements that <<Justice Scalia>> cites as evidence to the contrary
construe \\subsection (e)(3)\\ to strip this Court of jurisdiction, see
\\post,\\ at 666, n. 4 (dissenting opinion) (quoting 151 Cong. Rec.
S12796 (Nov. 15, 2005) (statement of Sen. Specter))—a construction
that the Government has expressly disavowed in this litigation, see n.
11, \\infra.\\ The inapposite November 14, 2005, statement of Senator
Graham, which <<Justice Scalia>> cites as evidence of that Senator’s
“assumption that pending cases are covered,” \\post,\\ at 666,

directly after the uncontradicted statement of his cosponsor, Senator
Levin, assuring members of the Senate that “the amendment will not
strip the courts of jurisdiction over [pending] cases,” \\id.,\\ at
S12755.

  The Government nonetheless offers two reasons why, in its view, no
negative inference may be drawn in favor of jurisdiction. First, it
asserts that \\Lindh\\ is inapposite because “Section 1005(e)(1) and
(h)(1) remove jurisdiction, while Section 1005(e)(2), (3) and (h)(2)
create an exclusive review mechanism and define the nature of that
review.” Reply Brief in Support of Respondents’ Motion to Dismiss
4. Because the provisions being contrasted “address wholly distinct
subject matters,” \\Martin\\ v. \\Hadix,\\ 527 U. S. 343, 356 (1999),
the Government argues, Congress’ different treatment of them is of no
significance.

  This argument must fail because it rests on a false distinction
between the “jurisdictional” nature of subsection (e)(1) and the
“procedural” character of subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3). In truth,
all three provisions govern jurisdiction over detainees’ claims;
subsection (e)(1) addresses jurisdiction in habeas cases and other
actions “relating to any aspect of the detention,” while subsections
(e)(2) and (e)(3) vest exclusive,[[11]] but limited, \\jurisdiction\\
in the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to review
“final decision[s]” of CSRTs and military commissions.

  That subsection (e)(1) strips jurisdiction while subsections (e)(2)
and (e)(3) restore it in limited form is hardly a distinction upon which
a negative inference must founder. <<Justice Scalia,>> in arguing to
the contrary, maintains that Con@@582@@gress had “ample reason” to
provide explicitly for application of subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3)
to pending cases because “jurisdiction-ousting” provisions like
subsection (e)(1) have been treated differently under our retroactivity
jurisprudence than “jurisdiction-creating” ones like subsections
(e)(2) and (e)(3). \\Post,\\ at 662 (dissenting opinion); see also Reply
Brief in Support of Respondents’ Motion to Dismiss 5–6. That theory
is insupportable. Assuming, \\arguendo,\\ that subsections (e)(2) and
(e)(3) “confer \\new\\ jurisdiction (in the D. C. Circuit) where there
was none before,” \\post,\\ at 662 (emphasis in original); but see
\\Rasul\\ v. \\Bush,\\ 542 U. S. 466 (2004), and that our precedents
can be read to “strongly indicat[e]” that jurisdiction-creating
statutes raise special retroactivity concerns not also raised by
jurisdiction-stripping statutes, \\post,\\ at 662,[[12]] subsections
(e)(2) and (e)(3) “confer” jurisdiction in a manner that cannot
conceivably give rise to retroactivity questions under our precedents.
The provisions impose no additional liability or obligation on any
private party or even on the United States, unless one counts the
burden of litigating an appeal—a burden not a single one of our cases
suggests triggers retroactivity concerns.[[13]] @@583@@ Moreover,
it strains credulity to suggest that the desire to reinforce the
application of subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) to pending cases drove
Congress to \\exclude\\ subsection (e)(1) from § 1005(h)(2).

^11 The District of Columbia Circuit’s jurisdiction, while
“exclusive” in one sense, would not bar this Court’s review on
appeal from a decision under the DTA. See Reply Brief in Support of
Respondents’ Motion to Dismiss 16–17, n. 12 (“While the DTA does
not expressly call for Supreme Court review of the District of Columbia
Circuit’s decisions, Section[s] 1005(e)(2) and (3). . .donot remove
this Court’s jurisdiction over such decisions under 28 U. S. C.
§ 1254(1)”).

^12 This assertion is itself highly questionable. The cases that
<<Justice Scalia>> cites to support his distinction are \\Republic of
Austria\\ v. \\Altmann,\\ 541 U. S. 677 (2004), and \\Hughes Aircraft
Co.\\ v. \\United States ex rel. Schumer,\\ 520 U. S. 939 (1997). See
\\post,\\ at 662. While the Court in both of those cases recognized
that statutes “creating” jurisdiction may have retroactive effect
if they affect “substantive” rights, see \\Altmann,\\ 541 U. S., at
695, and n. 15; \\Hughes Aircraft,\\ 520 U. S., at 951, we have applied
the same analysis to statutes that have jurisdiction-stripping effect,
see \\Lindh\\ v. \\Murphy,\\ 521 U. S. 320, 327–328 (1997); \\id.,\\
at 342–343 (Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting) (construing AEDPA’s
amendments as “ousting jurisdiction”).

^13 See \\Landgraf,\\ 511 U. S., at 271, n. 25 (observing that “the
great majority of our decisions relying upon the antiretroactivity
presumption have involved intervening statutes burdening private
parties,” though “we have applied the presumption in cases involving
\\new monetary obligations\\ that fell only on the government”
(emphasis added)); see also \\Altmann,\\ 541 U. S., at 728–729
(<<Kennedy,>> J., dissenting) (explaining that if retroactivity @@583@@
concerns do not arise when a new monetary obligation is imposed on
the United States it is because “Congress, by virtue of authoring
the legislation, is itself fully capable of protecting the Federal
Government from having its rights degraded by retroactive laws”).

  The Government’s second objection is that applying subsections
(e)(2) and (e)(3) but not (e)(1) to pending cases “produces an absurd
result” because it grants (albeit only temporarily) dual jurisdiction
over detainees’ cases in circumstances where the statute plainly
envisions that the D. C. Circuit will have \\“exclusive”\\ and
immediate jurisdiction over such cases. Reply Brief in Support of
Respondents’ Motion to Dismiss 7. But the premise here is faulty;
subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) grant jurisdiction only over actions
to “determine the validity of any final decision” of a CSRT or
commission. Because Hamdan, at least, is not contesting any “final
decision” of a CSRT or military commission, his action does not fall
within the scope of subsection (e)(2) or (e)(3). There is, then, no
absurdity.[[14]]

  The Government’s more general suggestion that Congress can have
had no good reason for preserving habeas jurisdiction over cases that
had been brought by detainees prior to enactment of the DTA not only
is belied by the legislative history, see n. 10, \\supra,\\ but is
otherwise without merit. There is nothing absurd about a scheme under
which pending habeas actions—particularly those, like this one, that
challenge the very legitimacy of the tribunals whose judgments Congress
would like to have reviewed—are preserved, and more routine challenges
to final decisions ren@@584@@dered by those tribunals are carefully
channeled to a particular court and through a particular lens of review.

^14 There may be habeas cases that were pending in the lower courts at
the time the DTA was enacted that do qualify as challenges to “final
decision[s]” within the meaning of subsection (e)(2) or (e)(3). We
express no view about whether the DTA would require transfer of such an
action to the D. C. Circuit.

  Finally, we cannot leave unaddressed <<Justice Scalia>>’s
contentions that the “meaning of § 1005(e)(1) is entirely clear,”
\\post,\\ at 660, and that “the \\plain import\\ of a statute
repealing jurisdiction is to eliminate the power to consider and render
judgment—in an already pending case no less than in a case yet to be
filed,” \\post,\\ at 657 (emphasis in original). Only by treating the
\\Bruner\\ rule as an inflexible trump (a thing it has never been, see
n. 7, \\supra\\) and ignoring both the rest of § 1005’s text and
its drafting history can one conclude as much. Congress here expressly
provided that subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) applied to pending cases.
It chose not to so provide—after having been presented with the
option—for subsection (e)(1). The omission is an integral part of
the statutory scheme that muddies whatever “plain meaning” may
be discerned from blinkered study of subsection (e)(1) alone. The
dissent’s speculation about what Congress might have intended by the
omission not only is counterfactual, cf. n. 10, \\supra\\ (recounting
legislative history), but rests on both a misconstruction of the DTA and
an erroneous view of our precedents, see \\supra,\\ at 582–583, and n.
12.

  For these reasons, we deny the Government’s motion to dismiss.[[15]]

# III

  Relying on our decision in \\Councilman,\\ 420 U. S. 738, the
Government argues that, even if we have statutory jurisdic@@585@@tion,
we should apply the “judge-made rule that civilian courts should await
the final outcome of on-going military proceedings before entertaining
an attack on those proceedings.” Brief for Respondents 12. Like the
District Court and the Court of Appeals before us, we reject this
argument.

^15 Because we conclude that § 1005(e)(1) does not strip federal
courts’ jurisdiction over cases pending on the date of the DTA’s
enactment, we do not decide whether, if it were otherwise, this Court
would nonetheless retain jurisdiction to hear Hamdan’s appeal. Cf.
\\supra,\\ at 575. Nor do we decide the manner in which the canon of
constitutional avoidance should affect subsequent interpretation of
the DTA. See, \\e. g., St. Cyr,\\ 533 U. S., at 300 (a construction of
a statute “that would entirely preclude review of a pure question
of law by any court would give rise to substantial constitutional
questions”).

  In \\Councilman,\\ an army officer on active duty was referred
to a court-martial for trial on charges that he violated the UCMJ
by selling, transferring, and possessing marijuana. 420 U. S., at
739–740. Objecting that the alleged offenses were not “ ‘service
connected,’ ” \\id.,\\ at 740, the officer filed suit in Federal
District Court to enjoin the proceedings. He neither questioned the
lawfulness of courts-martial or their procedures nor disputed that, as
a serviceman, he was subject to court-martial jurisdiction. His sole
argument was that the subject matter of his case did not fall within
the scope of court-martial authority. See \\id.,\\ at 741, 759. The
District Court granted his request for injunctive relief, and the Court
of Appeals affirmed.

  We granted certiorari and reversed. \\Id.,\\ at 761. We did not reach
the merits of whether the marijuana charges were sufficiently “service
connected” to place them within the subject-matter jurisdiction of
a court-martial. Instead, we concluded that, as a matter of comity,
federal courts should normally abstain from intervening in pending
court-martial proceedings against members of the Armed Forces,[[16]] and
@@586@@ further that there was nothing in the particular circumstances
of the officer’s case to displace that general rule. See \\id.,\\ at
740, 758.

^16 \\Councilman\\ distinguished service personnel from civilians, whose
challenges to ongoing military proceedings are cognizable in federal
court. See, \\e. g., United States ex rel. Toth\\ v. \\Quarles,\\ 350
U. S. 11 (1955). As we explained in \\Councilman,\\ abstention is not
appropriate in cases in which individuals raise “ ‘substantial
arguments denying the right of the military to try them at all,’
” and in which the legal challenge “turn[s] on the status of the
persons as to whom the military asserted its power.” 420 U. S., at
759 (quoting \\Noyd\\ v. \\Bond,\\ 395 U. S. 683, 696, n. 8 (1969)).
In other words, we do not apply \\Councilman\\ abstention when there
is a substantial question whether a military tribunal has personal
jurisdiction over the defendant. Because we conclude that abstention
is inappropriate @@586@@ for a more basic reason, we need not consider
whether the jurisdictional exception recognized in \\Councilman\\
applies here.

  \\Councilman\\ identifies two considerations of comity that together
favor abstention pending completion of ongoing court-martial proceedings
against service personnel. See \\New\\ v. \\Cohen,\\ 129 F. 3d 639, 643
(CADC 1997); see also 415 F. 3d, at 36–37 (discussing \\Councilman\\
and \\New\\). First, military discipline and, therefore, the efficient
operation of the Armed Forces are best served if the military justice
system acts without regular interference from civilian courts. See
\\Councilman,\\ 420 U. S., at 752. Second, federal courts should
respect the balance that Congress struck between military preparedness
and fairness to individual service members when it created “an
integrated system of military courts and review procedures, a critical
element of which is the Court of Military Appeals consisting of
civilian judges ‘completely removed from all military influence or
persuasion. . . .’” \\Id.,\\ at 758 (quoting H. R. Rep. No. 491, 81st
Cong., 1st Sess., 7 (1949)). Just as abstention in the face of ongoing
state criminal proceedings is justified by our expectation that state
courts will enforce federal rights, so abstention in the face of ongoing
court-martial proceedings is justified by our expectation that the
military court system established by Congress—with its substantial
procedural protections and provision for appellate review by independent
civilian judges—“will vindicate servicemen’s constitutional
rights,” 420 U. S., at 758. See \\id.,\\ at 755–758.[[17]] @@587@@

^17 See also \\Noyd,\\ 395 U. S., at 694–696 (noting that the Court
of Military Appeals consisted of “disinterested civilian judges,”
and concluding that there was no reason for the Court to address an Air
Force Captain’s argument that he was entitled to remain free from
confinement pending appeal of his conviction by court-martial “when
the highest military court stands ready to consider petitioner’s
arguments”). Cf. \\Parisi\\ v. \\Davidson,\\ 405 @@587@@ U. S. 34,
41–43 (1972) (“Under accepted principles of comity, the court should
stay its hand only if the relief the petitioner seeks . . . would also
be available to him with reasonable promptness and certainty through
the machinery of the military judicial system in its processing of the
courtmartial charge”).

  The same cannot be said here; indeed, neither of the comity
considerations identified in \\Councilman\\ weighs in favor of
abstention in this case. First, Hamdan is not a member of our
Nation’s Armed Forces, so concerns about military discipline do not
apply. Second, the tribunal convened to try Hamdan is not part of
the integrated system of military courts, complete with independent
review panels, that Congress has established. Unlike the officer in
\\Councilman,\\ Hamdan has no right to appeal any conviction to the
civilian judges of the Court of Military Appeals (now called the United
States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, see § 924, 108 Stat.
2831). Instead, under Dept. of Defense Military Commission Order No.
1 (Commission Order No. 1), App. C to Brief for Petitioner 46a, which
was issued by the Secretary of Defense on March 21, 2002, and amended
most recently on August 31, 2005, and which governs the procedures for
Hamdan’s commission, any conviction would be reviewed by a panel
consisting of three military officers designated by the Secretary.
\\Id.,\\ § 6(H)(4). Commission Order No. 1 provides that appeal of
a review panel’s decision may be had only to the Secretary himself,
§ 6(H)(5), and then, finally, to the President, § 6(H)(6).[[18]]

  We have no doubt that the various individuals assigned review power
under Commission Order No. 1 would strive to act impartially and
ensure that Hamdan receive all protections to which he is entitled.
Nonetheless, these review bodies clearly lack the structural insulation
from military influence that characterizes the Court of Appeals for the
@@588@@ Armed Forces, and thus bear insufficient conceptual similarity
to state courts to warrant invocation of abstention principles.[[19]]

^18 If he chooses, the President may delegate this ultimate
decision-making authority to the Secretary of Defense. See § 6(H)(6).

  In sum, neither of the two comity considerations underlying our
decision to abstain in \\Councilman\\ applies to the circumstances
of this case. Instead, this Court’s decision in \\Quirin\\ is the
most relevant precedent. In \\Quirin,\\ eight German saboteurs were
captured upon arrival by submarine in New York and Florida. 317 U. S.,
at 21. The President convened a military commission to try seven of the
saboteurs, who then filed habeas corpus petitions in the United States
District Court for the District of Columbia challenging their trial
by commission. We granted the saboteurs’ petition for certiorari to
the Court of Appeals before judgment. See \\id.,\\ at 19. Far from
abstaining pending the conclusion of military proceedings, which were
ongoing, we convened a special Term to hear the case and expedited our
review. That course of action was warranted, we explained, “[i]n view
of the public importance of the questions raised by [the cases] and of
the duty which rests on the courts, in time of war as well as in time
of peace, to preserve unimpaired the constitutional safeguards of civil
liberty, and because in our opinion the public interest required that
we consider and decide those questions without any avoidable delay.”
\\Ibid.\\

  As the Court of Appeals here recognized, \\Quirin\\ “provides a
compelling historical precedent for the power of civilian courts to
entertain challenges that seek to interrupt the @@589@@ processes of
military commissions.” 415 F. 3d, at 36.[[20]] The circumstances
of this case, like those in \\Quirin,\\ simply do not implicate the
“obligations of comity” that, under appropriate circumstances,
justify abstention. \\Quackenbush\\ v. \\Allstate Ins. Co.,\\ 517 U. S.
706, 733 (1996) (<<Kennedy,>> J., concurring).

^19 <<Justice Scalia>> chides us for failing to include the D. C.
Circuit’s review powers under the DTA in our description of the review
mechanism erected by Commission Order No. 1. See \\post,\\ at 675.
Whether or not the limited review permitted under the DTA may be treated
as akin to the plenary review exercised by the Court of Appeals for the
Armed Forces, petitioner here is not afforded a right to such review.
See \\infra,\\ at 616; § 1005(e)(3), 119 Stat. 2743.

  Finally, the Government has identified no other “important
countervailing interest” that would permit federal courts to depart
from their general “duty to exercise the jurisdiction that is
conferred upon them by Congress.” \\Id.,\\ at 716 (majority opinion).
To the contrary, Hamdan and the Government both have a compelling
interest in knowing in advance whether Hamdan may be tried by a military
commission that arguably is without any basis in law and oper@@590@@ates
free from many of the procedural rules prescribed by Congress for
courts-martial—rules intended to safeguard the accused and ensure the
reliability of any conviction. While we certainly do not foreclose the
possibility that abstention may be appropriate in some cases seeking
review of ongoing military commission proceedings (such as military
commissions convened on the battlefield), the foregoing discussion makes
clear that, under our precedent, abstention is not justified here. We
therefore proceed to consider the merits of Hamdan’s challenge.

^20 Having correctly declined to abstain from addressing Hamdan’s
challenge to the lawfulness of the military commission convened
to try him, the Court of Appeals suggested that \\Councilman\\
abstention nonetheless applied to bar its consideration of one of
Hamdan’s arguments—namely, that his commission violated Article
3 of the Third Geneva Convention, 6 U. S. T. 3316, 3318. See Part
VI, \\infra.\\ Although the Court of Appeals rejected the Article 3
argument on the merits, it also stated that, because the challenge was
not “jurisdictional,” it did not fall within the exception that
\\Schlesinger\\ v. \\Councilman,\\ 420 U. S. 738 (1975), recognized
for defendants who raise substantial arguments that a military tribunal
lacks personal jurisdiction over them. See 415 F. 3d, at 42.

  ^ In reaching this conclusion, the Court of Appeals conflated two
distinct inquiries: (1) whether Hamdan has raised a substantial
argument that the military commission lacks authority to try him; and,
more fundamentally, (2) whether the comity considerations underlying
\\Councilman\\ apply to trigger the abstention principle in the first
place. As the Court of Appeals acknowledged at the beginning of its
opinion, the first question warrants consideration only if the answer
to the second is yes. See 415 F. 3d, at 36–37. Since, as the Court of
Appeals properly concluded, the answer to the second question is in fact
no, there is no need to consider any exception.

  ^ At any rate, it appears that the exception would apply here. As
discussed in Part VI, \\infra,\\ Hamdan raises a substantial argument
that, because the military commission that has been convened to try him
is not a “ ‘regularly constituted court’ ” under the Geneva
Conventions, it is ultra vires and thus lacks jurisdiction over him.
Brief for Petitioner 5.

# IV

  The military commission, a tribunal neither mentioned in the
Constitution nor created by statute, was born of military necessity.
See W. Winthrop, Military Law and Precedents 831 (rev. 2d ed. 1920)
(hereinafter Winthrop). Though foreshadowed in some respects by earlier
tribunals like the Board of General Officers that General Washington
convened to try British Major John Andre´ for spying during the
Revolutionary War, the commission “as such” was inaugurated in
1847. \\Id.,\\ at 832; G. Davis, A Treatise on the Military Law of the
United States 308 (rev. 3d ed. 1915) (hereinafter Davis). As commander
of occupied Mexican territory, and having available to him no other
tribunal, General Winfield Scott that year ordered the establishment
of both “ ‘\\military commissions\\’ ” to try ordinary crimes
committed in the occupied territory and a \\“council of war”\\
to try offenses against the law of war. Winthrop 832 (emphasis in
original).

  When the exigencies of war next gave rise to a need for use of
military commissions, during the Civil War, the dual system favored by
General Scott was not adopted. Instead, a single tribunal often took
jurisdiction over ordinary crimes, war crimes, and breaches of military
orders alike. As further discussed below, each aspect of that seemingly
broad jurisdiction was in fact supported by a separate military
exigency. Generally, though, the need for military com@@591@@missions
during this period—as during the Mexican War— was driven largely
by the then very limited jurisdiction of courts-martial: “The
\\occasion\\ for the military commission arises principally from the
fact that the jurisdiction of the court-martial proper, in our law, is
restricted by statute almost exclusively to members of the military
force and to certain specific offences defined in a written code.”
\\Id.,\\ at 831 (emphasis in original).

  Exigency alone, of course, will not justify the establishment and use
of penal tribunals not contemplated by Article I, § 8, and Article
III, § 1, of the Constitution unless some other part of that document
authorizes a response to the felt need. See \\Ex parte Milligan,\\ 4
Wall. 2, 121 (1866) (“Certainly no part of the judicial power of
the country was conferred on [military commissions]”); \\Ex parte
Vallandigham,\\ 1 Wall. 243, 251 (1864); see also \\Quirin,\\ 317 U. S.,
at 25 (“Congress and the President, like the courts, possess no power
not derived from the Constitution”). And that authority, if it exists,
can derive only from the powers granted jointly to the President and
Congress in time of war. See \\id.,\\ at 26–29; \\In re Yamashita,\\
327 U. S. 1, 11 (1946).

  The Constitution makes the President the “Commander in Chief” of
the Armed Forces, Art. II, §2, cl. 1, but vests in Congress the powers
to “declare War. . . and make Rules concerning Captures on Land and
Water,” Art. I, § 8, cl. 11, to “raise and support Armies,”
\\id.,\\ cl. 12, to “define and punish . . . Offences against the Law
of Nations,” \\id.,\\ cl. 10, and “To make Rules for the Government
and Regulation of the land and naval Forces,” \\id.,\\ cl. 14. The
interplay between these powers was described by Chief Justice Chase in
the seminal case of \\Ex parte Milligan:\\

    “The power to make the necessary laws is in Congress; the power
to execute in the President. Both powers imply many subordinate and
auxiliary powers. Each includes all authorities essential to its due
exercise. But neither can the President, in war more than in @@592@@
peace, intrude upon the proper authority of Congress, nor Congress upon
the proper authority of the President. . . . Congress cannot direct the
conduct of campaigns, nor can the President, or any commander under him,
without the sanction of Congress, institute tribunals for the trial and
punishment of offences, either of soldiers or civilians, unless in cases
of a controlling necessity, which justifies what it compels, or at least
insures acts of indemnity from the justice of the legislature.” 4
Wall., at 139–140.[[21]]

  Whether Chief Justice Chase was correct in suggesting that the
President may constitutionally convene military commissions “without
the sanction of Congress” in cases of “controlling necessity”
is a question this Court has not answered definitively, and need not
answer today. For we held in \\Quirin\\ that Congress had, through
Article of War 15, sanctioned the use of military commissions in
such circumstances. 317 U. S., at 28 (“By the Articles of War, and
especially Article 15, Congress has explicitly provided, so far as
it may constitutionally do so, that military tribunals shall have
jurisdiction to try offenders or offenses against the law of war in
appropriate cases”). Article 21 of the UCMJ, the language of which
is substantially identical to the old Article 15 and was preserved by
Congress after World War II,[[22]] reads as follows: @@593@@

    “Jurisdiction of courts-martial not exclusive. “The provisions
of this code conferring jurisdiction upon courts-martial shall not be
construed as depriving military commissions, provost courts, or other
military tribunals of concurrent jurisdiction in respect of offenders
or offenses that by statute or by the law of war may be tried by such
military commissions, provost courts, or other military tribunals.” 64
Stat. 115.

^21 See also Winthrop 831 (“[I]n general, it is those provisions
of the Constitution which empower Congress to ‘declare war’ and
‘raise armies,’ and which, in authorizing the initiation of \\war,\\
authorize the employment of all necessary and proper agencies for
its due prosecution, from which this tribunal derives its original
sanction” (emphasis in original)).

^22 Article 15 was first adopted as part of the Articles of War in
1916. See Act of Aug. 29, 1916, ch. 418, § 3, Art. 15, 39 Stat. 652.
When the Articles of War were codified and reenacted as the UCMJ in
1950, Congress determined to retain Article 15 because it had been
“construed by the Supreme Court (\\Ex Parte Quirin,\\ 317 U. S. 1
(1942)).” S. Rep. No. 486, 81st Cong., 1st Sess., 13 (1949).

  We have no occasion to revisit \\Quirin\\’s controversial
characterization of Article of War 15 as congressional authorization
for military commissions. Cf. Brief for Legal Scholars and Historians
as \\Amici Curiae\\ 12–15. Contrary to the Government’s assertion,
however, even \\Quirin\\ did not view the authorization as a sweeping
mandate for the President to “invoke military commissions when
he deems them necessary.” Brief for Respondents 17. Rather, the
\\Quirin\\ Court recognized that Congress had simply preserved what
power, under the Constitution and the common law of war, the President
had had before 1916 to convene military commissions—with the express
condition that the President and those under his command comply with the
law of war. See 317 U. S., at 28–29.[[23]] That much is evidenced by
the Court’s inquiry, \\following\\ its conclusion that Congress had
authorized military commissions, into whether the law of war had indeed
been complied with in that case. See \\ibid.\\

  The Government would have us dispense with the inquiry that the
\\Quirin\\ Court undertook and find in either the AUMF or the DTA
specific, overriding authorization for the very commission that has
been convened to try Hamdan. Neither of these congressional Acts,
however, expands the @@594@@ President’s authority to convene
military commissions. First, while we assume that the AUMF activated
the President’s war powers, see \\Hamdi\\ v. \\Rumsfeld,\\ 542 U. S.
507 (2004) (plurality opinion), and that those powers include the
authority to convene military commissions in appropriate circumstances,
see \\id.,\\ at 518; \\Quirin,\\ 317 U. S., at 28–29; see also
\\Yamashita,\\ 327 U. S., at 11, there is nothing in the text or
legislative history of the AUMF even hinting that Congress intended to
expand or alter the authorization set forth in Article 21 of the UCMJ.
Cf. \\Yerger,\\ 8 Wall., at 105 (“Repeals by implication are not
favored”).[[24]]

^23 Whether or not the President has independent power, absent
congressional authorization, to convene military commissions, he may not
disregard limitations that Congress has, in proper exercise of its own
war powers, placed on his powers. See \\Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co.\\ v.
\\Sawyer,\\ 343 U. S. 579, 637 (1952) (Jackson, J., concurring). The
Government does not argue otherwise.

  Likewise, the DTA cannot be read to authorize this commission.
Although the DTA, unlike either Article 21 or the AUMF, was enacted
after the President had convened Hamdan’s commission, it contains
no language authorizing that tribunal or any other at Guantanamo Bay.
The DTA obviously “recognize[s]” the existence of the Guantanamo
Bay commissions in the weakest sense, Brief for Respondents 15,
because it references some of the military orders governing them and
creates limited judicial review of their “final decision[s],” DTA
§ 1005(e)(3), 119 Stat. 2743. But the statute also pointedly reserves
judgment on whether “the Constitution and laws of the United States
are applicable” in reviewing such decisions and whether, if they
are, the “standards and procedures” used to try Hamdan and other
detainees actually violate the “Constitution and laws.” \\Ibid.\\

  Together, the UCMJ, the AUMF, and the DTA at most acknowledge a
general Presidential authority to convene mil@@595@@itary commissions
in circumstances where justified under the “Constitution and laws,”
including the law of war. Absent a more specific congressional
authorization, the task of this Court is, as it was in \\Quirin,\\ to
decide whether Hamdan’s military commission is so justified. It is to
that inquiry we now turn.

^24 On this point, it is noteworthy that the Court in \\Ex parte
Quirin,\\ 317 U. S. 1 (1942), looked beyond Congress’ declaration of
war and accompanying authorization for use of force during World War
II, and relied instead on Article of War 15 to find that Congress had
authorized the use of military commissions in some circumstances. See
\\id.,\\ at 26–29. <<Justice Thomas>>’ assertion that we commit
“error” in reading Article 21 of the UCMJ to place limitations upon
the President’s use of military commissions, see \\post,\\ at 682
(dissenting opinion), ignores the reasoning in \\Quirin.\\

# V

  The common law governing military commissions may be gleaned from
past practice and what sparse legal precedent exists. Commissions
historically have been used in three situations. See Bradley &
Goldsmith, Congressional Authorization and the War on Terrorism, 118
Harv. L. Rev. 2048, 2132–2133 (2005); Winthrop 831–846; Hearings
on H. R. 2498 before the Subcommittee of the House Committee on
Armed Services, 81st Cong., 1st Sess., 975 (1949). First, they have
substituted for civilian courts at times and in places where martial
law has been declared. Their use in these circumstances has raised
constitutional questions, see \\Duncan\\ v. \\Kahanamoku,\\ 327
U. S. 304 (1946); \\Milligan,\\ 4 Wall., at 121–122, but is well
recognized.[[25]] See Winthrop 822, 836–839. Second, commissions
have been established to try civilians “as part of a temporary
military government over occupied enemy territory or territory regained
from an@@596@@enemy where civilian government cannot and does not
function.” \\Duncan,\\ 327 U. S., at 314; see \\Milligan,\\ 4 Wall.,
at 141–142 (Chase, C. J., concurring in judgment) (distinguishing
“<<martial law proper>>” from “<<military government>>” in
occupied territory). Illustrative of this second kind of commission is
the one that was established, with jurisdiction to apply the German
Criminal Code, in occupied Germany following the end of World War II.
See \\Madsen\\ v. \\Kinsella,\\ 343 U. S. 341, 356 (1952).[[26]]

^25 The justification for, and limitations on, these commissions were
summarized in \\Milligan:\\

  ^ “If, in foreign invasion or civil war, the courts are actually
closed, and it is impossible to administer criminal justice according
to law, \\then,\\ on the theatre of active military operations, where
war really prevails, there is a necessity to furnish a substitute for
the civil authority, thus overthrown, to preserve the safety of the army
and society; and as no power is left but the military, it is allowed
to govern by martial rule until the laws can have their free course.
As necessity creates the rule, so it limits its duration; for, if this
government is continued \\after\\ the courts are reinstated, it is
a gross usurpation of power. Martial rule can never exist where the
courts are open, and in the proper and unobstructed exercise of their
jurisdiction. It is also confined to the locality of actual war.” 4
Wall., at 127 (emphasis in original).

  The third type of commission, convened as an “incident to the
  conduct of war” when there is a need “to seize and subject to
  disciplinary measures those enemies who in their attempt to thwart
  or impede our military effort have violated the law of war,”
  \\Quirin,\\ 317 U. S., at 28–29, has been described as “utterly
  different” from the other two. Bickers, Military Commissions are
  Constitutionally Sound: A Response to Professors Katyal and Tribe,
  34 Tex. Tech. L. Rev. 899, 902 (2002–2003).[[27]] Not only is its
  jurisdiction limited to offenses cognizable during time of war, but
  its role is primarily a factfinding one—to determine, typically on
  the battle@@597@@field itself, whether the defendant has violated the
  law of war. The last time the U. S. Armed Forces used the law-of-war
  military commission was during World War II. In \\Quirin,\\ this Court
  sanctioned President Roosevelt’s use of such a tribunal to try Nazi
  saboteurs captured on American soil during the War. 317 U. S. 1. And
  in \\Yamashita,\\ we held that a military commission had jurisdiction
  to try a Japanese commander for failing to prevent troops under his
  command from committing atrocities in the Philippines. 327 U.S. 1.

^26 The limitations on these occupied territory or military government
commissions are tailored to the tribunals’ purpose and the exigencies
that necessitate their use. They may be employed “pending the
establishment of civil government,” \\Madsen,\\ 343 U. S., at
354–355, which may in some cases extend beyond the “cessation of
hostilities,” \\id.,\\ at 348.

^27 So much may not be evident on cold review of the Civil War trials
often cited as precedent for this kind of tribunal because the
commissions established during that conflict operated as both martial
law or military government tribunals and law-of-war commissions. Hence,
“military commanders began the practice [during the Civil War] of
using the same name, the same rules, and often, the same tribunals”
to try both ordinary crimes and war crimes. Bickers, 34 Tex. Tech. L.
Rev., at 908. “For the first time, accused horse thieves and alleged
saboteurs found themselves subject to trial by the same military
commission.” \\Id.,\\ at 909. The Civil War precedents must therefore
be considered with caution; as we recognized in \\Quirin,\\ 317 U. S.,
at 29, and as further discussed below, commissions convened during time
of war but under neither martial law nor military government may try
only offenses against the law of war.

  \\Quirin\\ is the model the Government invokes most frequently to
defend the commission convened to try Hamdan. That is both appropriate
and unsurprising. Since Guantanamo Bay is neither enemy-occupied
territory nor under martial law, the law-of-war commission is the only
model available. At the same time, no more robust model of executive
power exists; \\Quirin\\ represents the high-water mark of military
power to try enemy combatants for war crimes.

  The classic treatise penned by Colonel William Winthrop, whom we
have called “the ‘Blackstone of Military Law,’” \\Reid\\
v. \\Covert,\\ 354 U. S. 1, 19, n. 38 (1957) (plurality opinion),
describes at least four preconditions for exercise of jurisdiction by
a tribunal of the type convened to try Hamdan. First, “[a] military
commission, (except where otherwise authorized by statute), can legally
assume jurisdiction only of offences committed within the field of the
command of the convening commander.” Winthrop 836. The “field of
the command” in these circumstances means the “theatre of war.”
\\Ibid.\\ Second, the offense charged “must have been committed
within the period of the war.”[[28]] \\Id.,\\ at 837. No jurisdiction
exists to try offenses “committed either before or after the war.”
\\Ibid.\\ Third, a military commission not established pursuant to
martial law or an occupation may try @@598@@ only “[i]ndividuals of
the enemy’s army who have been guilty of illegitimate warfare or other
offences in violation of the laws of war” and members of one’s
own army “who, in time of war, become chargeable with crimes or
offences not cognizable, or triable, by the criminal courts or under the
Articles of war.” \\Id.,\\ at 838. Finally, a law-of-war commission
has jurisdiction to try only two kinds of offense: “Violations of the
laws and usages of war cognizable by military tribunals only,” and
“[b]reaches of military orders or regulations for which offenders
are not legally triable by court-martial under the Articles of war.”
\\Id.,\\ at 839.[[29]]

^28 If the commission is established pursuant to martial law or military
government, its jurisdiction extends to offenses committed within “the
exercise of military government or martial law.” Winthrop 837.

  All parties agree that Colonel Winthrop’s treatise accurately
describes the common law governing military commissions, and that the
jurisdictional limitations he identifies were incorporated in Article of
War 15 and, later, Article 21 of the UCMJ. It also is undisputed that
Hamdan’s commission lacks jurisdiction to try him unless the charge
“properly set[s] forth, not only the details of the act charged,
but the circumstances conferring \\jurisdiction.\\” \\Id.,\\ at 842
(emphasis in original). The question is whether the preconditions
designed to ensure that a military necessity exists to justify the use
of this extraordinary tribunal have been satisfied here.

  The charge against Hamdan, described in detail in Part I, \\supra,\\
alleges a conspiracy extending over a number of years, from 1996 to
November 2001.[[30]] All but two months of that more than 5-year-long
period preceded the attacks of @@599@@ September 11, 2001, and the
enactment of the AUMF—the Act of Congress on which the Government
relies for exercise of its war powers and thus for its authority to
convene military commissions.[[31]] Neither the purported agreement with
@@600@@ Usama bin Laden and others to commit war crimes, nor a single
overt act, is alleged to have occurred in a theater of war or on any
specified date after September 11, 2001. None of the overt acts that
Hamdan is alleged to have committed violates the law of war.

^29 Winthrop adds as a fifth, albeit not-always-complied-with, criterion
that “the \\trial\\ must be had within the theatre of war. . .; that, if
held elsewhere, and where the civil courts are open and available, the
proceedings and sentence will be \\coram non judice.\\” \\Id.,\\ at
836. The Government does not assert that Guantanamo Bay is a theater of
war, but instead suggests that neither Washington, D. C., in 1942 nor
the Philippines in 1945 qualified as a “war zone” either. Brief for
Respondents 27; cf. \\Quirin,\\ 317 U.S. 1; \\In re Yamashita,\\ 327
U. S. 1 (1946).

^30 The elements of this conspiracy charge have been defined not by
Congress but by the President. See Military Commission Instruction No.
2, 32 CFR § 11.6 (2005).

^31 <<Justice Thomas>> would treat Usama bin Laden’s 1996 declaration
of jihad against Americans as the inception of the war. See \\post,\\
at 683–688 (dissenting opinion). But even the Government does not
go so far; although the United States had for some time prior to the
attacks of September 11, 2001, been aggressively pursuing al Qaeda,
neither in the charging document nor in submissions before this Court
has the Government asserted that the President’s \\war powers\\ were
activated prior to September 11, 2001. Cf. Brief for Respondents 25
(describing the events of September 11, 2001, as “an act of war”
that “triggered a right to deploy military forces abroad to defend
the United States by combating al Qaeda”). <<Justice Thomas>>’
further argument that the AUMF is “backward looking” and therefore
authorizes \\trial by military commission\\ of crimes that occurred
prior to the inception of war is insupportable. See \\post,\\ at 685, n.
3. If nothing else, Article 21 of the UCMJ requires that the President
comply with the law of war in his use of military commissions. As
explained in the text, the law of war permits trial only of offenses
“committed within the period of the war.” Winthrop 837; see also
\\Quirin,\\ 317 U. S., at 28–29 (observing that law-of-war military
commissions may be used to try “those enemies \\who in their attempt
to thwart or impede our military effort\\ have violated the law of
war” (emphasis added)). The sources that <<Justice Thomas>> relies
on to suggest otherwise simply do not support his position. Colonel
Green’s short exegesis on military commissions cites Howland for the
proposition that “[o]ffenses committed before a \\formal declaration
of war\\ or \\before the declaration of martial law\\ may be tried by
military commission.” The Military Commission, 42 Am. J. Int’l L.
832, 848 (1948) (emphasis added) (cited \\post,\\ at 686). Assuming that
to be true, nothing in our analysis turns on the admitted absence of
either a formal declaration of war or a declaration of martial law. Our
focus instead is on the September 11, 2001, attacks that the Government
characterizes as the relevant “act[s] of war,” and on the measure
that authorized the President’s deployment of military force— the
AUMF. Because we do not question the Government’s position that
the war commenced with the events of September 11, 2001, the \\Prize
Cases,\\ 2 Black 635 (1863) (cited \\post,\\ at 679, 684, 685, and 687
(<<Thomas,>> J., dissenting)), are not germane to the analysis.

  ^ Finally, <<Justice Thomas>>’ assertion that Julius Otto Kuehn’s
trial by military commission “for conspiring with Japanese officials
to betray the United States Fleet to the Imperial Japanese Government
prior to its @@600@@ attack on Pearl Harbor” stands as authoritative
precedent for Hamdan’s trial by commission, \\post,\\ at 686,
misses the mark in three critical respects. First, Kuehn was tried
for \\federal espionage crimes\\ under what were then 50 U. S. C.
§§ 31, 32, and 34, \\not\\ with common-law violations of the law of
war. See Hearings before the Joint Committee on the Investigation of
the Pearl Harbor Attack, 79th Cong., 1st Sess., pt. 30, pp. 3067–3069
(1946). Second, he was tried by \\martial law\\ commission (a kind
of commission <<Justice Thomas>> acknowledges is not relevant to the
analysis here, and whose jurisdiction extends to offenses committed
within “the exercise of . . . martial law,” Winthrop 837; see,
n. 28, \\supra\\), not a commission established exclusively to try
violations of the law of war, see Winthrop 837. Third, the martial law
commissions established to try crimes in Hawaii were ultimately declared
illegal by this Court. See \\Duncan\\ v. \\Kahanamoku,\\ 327 U. S. 304,
324 (1946) (“The phrase ‘martial law’ as employed in [the Hawaiian
Organic Act], while intended to authorize the military to act vigorously
for the maintenance of an orderly civil government and for the defense
of the Islands against actual or threatened rebellion or invasion,
was not intended to authorize the supplanting of courts by military
tribunals”).

  These facts alone cast doubt on the legality of the charge and, hence,
  the commission; as Winthrop makes plain, the offense alleged must have
  been committed both in a theater of war and \\during,\\ not before,
  the relevant conflict. But the deficiencies in the time and place
  allegations also underscore—indeed are symptomatic of—the most
  serious defect of this charge: The offense it alleges is not triable
  by law-of-war military commission. See \\Yamashita,\\ 327 U. S., at 13
  (“Neither congressional action nor the military orders constituting
  the commission authorized it to place petitioner on trial unless
  the charge proffered against him is of a violation of the law of
  war”).[[32]] @@601@@

^32 <<Justice Thomas>> adopts the remarkable view, not advocated by the
Government, that the charging document in this case actually includes
more than one charge: Conspiracy \\and\\ several other ill-defined
crimes, @@601@@ like “joining an organization” that has a criminal
purpose, “ ‘[b]eing a guerrilla,’ ” and aiding the enemy. See
\\post,\\ at 693–697, and n. 9. There are innumerable problems with
this approach.

  ^ First, the crimes <<Justice Thomas>> identifies were not actually
charged. It is one thing to observe that charges before a military
commission “ ‘need not be stated with the precision of a common
law indictment,’ ” \\post,\\ at 692, n. 7; it is quite another
to say that a crime \\not charged\\ may nonetheless be read into an
indictment. Second, the Government plainly had available to it the tools
and the time it needed to charge petitioner with the various crimes
<<Justice Thomas>> refers to, if it believed they were supported by
the allegations. As <<Justice Thomas>> himself observes, see \\post,\\
at 697, the crime of aiding the enemy may, in circumstances where the
accused owes allegiance to the party whose enemy he is alleged to have
aided, be triable by military commission pursuant to Article 104 of the
UCMJ, 10 U. S. C. §904. Indeed, the Government has charged detainees
under this provision when it has seen fit to do so. See Brief for David
Hicks as \\Amicus Curiae\\ 7.

  ^ Third, the cases <<Justice Thomas>> relies on to show that Hamdan
may be guilty of violations of the law of war not actually charged do
not support his argument. <<Justice Thomas>> begins by blurring the
distinction between those categories of “offender” who may be tried
by military commission (\\e. g.,\\ jayhawkers and the like) with the
“offenses” that may be so tried. Even when it comes to “ ‘being
a guerrilla,’ ” cf. \\post,\\ at 695, n. 9, a label alone does not
render a person susceptible to execution or other criminal punishment;
the charge of “ ‘being a guerrilla’ ” invariably is accompanied
by the allegation that the defendant “ ‘took up arms’ ” as
such. This is because, as explained by Judge Advocate General Holt in
a decision upholding the charge of “ ‘being a guerrilla’ ” as
one recognized by “the universal usage of the times,” the charge is
simply shorthand (akin to “being a spy”) for “the perpetration of
a succession of similar acts” of violence. Record Books of the Judge
Advocate General Office, R. 3, 590. The sources cited by <<Justice
Thomas>> confirm as much. See cases cited \\post,\\ at 694–695, n. 9.

  ^ Likewise, the suggestion that the Nuremberg precedents support
Hamdan’s conviction for the (uncharged) crime of joining a criminal
organization must fail. Cf. \\post,\\ at 695–697. The convictions
of certain high-level Nazi officials for “membership in a criminal
organization” were secured pursuant to specific provisions of the
Charter of the International Military @@602@@ Tribunal that permitted
indictment of individual organization members following convictions
of the organizations themselves. See Arts. 9 and 10, in 1 Trial of
the Major War Criminals Before the International Military Tribunal:
Nuremberg, 14 November 1945–1 October 1946, p. 12 (1947). The initial
plan to use organizations’ convictions as predicates for mass
individual trials ultimately was abandoned. See T. Taylor, Anatomy of
the Nuremberg Trials: A Personal Memoir 584–585, 638 (1992).

  There is no suggestion that Congress has, in exercise of its
constitutional authority to “define and punish . . . Offences
against the Law of Nations,” U. S. Const., Art. I, § 8, cl. 10,
@@602@@ positively identified “conspiracy” as a war crime.[[33]]
As we explained in \\Quirin,\\ that is not necessarily fatal to the
Government’s claim of authority to try the alleged offense by
military commission; Congress, through Article 21 of the UCMJ, has
“incorporated by reference” the common law of war, which may render
triable by military commission certain offenses not defined by statute.
317 U. S., at 30. When, however, neither the elements of the offense nor
the range of permissible punishments is defined by statute or treaty,
the precedent must be plain and unambiguous. To demand any less would
be to risk concentrating in military hands a degree of adjudicative and
punitive power in excess of that contemplated either by statute or by
the Constitution. Cf. \\Loving\\ v. \\United States,\\ 517 U. S. 748,
771 (1996) (acknowledging that Congress “may not delegate the power
to make laws”); \\Reid,\\ 354 U. S., at 23–24 (“The Founders
envisioned the army as a necessary institution, but one dangerous to
liberty if not confined within its essential bounds”); The Federalist
No. 47, p. 324 (J. Cooke ed. 1961) (J. Madison) (“The accumulation of
all powers legislative, executive and judiciary in the same hands. . . may
justly be pronounced the very definition of tyranny”).[[34]] @@603@@

^33 Cf. 10 U. S. C. § 904 (making triable by military commission
the crime of aiding the enemy); § 906 (same for spying); War Crimes
Act of 1996, 18 U. S. C. §2441 (2000 ed. and Supp. III) (listing war
crimes); Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs
Appropriations Act, 1998, § 583, 111 Stat. 2436 (same).

^34 While the common law necessarily is “evolutionary in nature,”
\\post,\\ at 689 (<<Thomas,>> J., dissenting), even in jurisdictions
where common-law crimes are still part of the penal framework, an
act does not become a @@603@@ crime without its foundations having
been firmly established in precedent. See, \\e. g., Queen\\ v.
\\Rimmington,\\ [2006] 2 All E. R. 257, 275–279 (2005) (House of
Lords); \\id.,\\ at 279 (while “some degree of vagueness is inevitable
and development of the law is a recognised feature of common law
courts[,] . . . the law-making function of the courts must remain within
reasonable limits”); see also \\Rogers\\ v. \\Tennessee,\\ 532 U. S.
451, 472–478 (2001) (<<Scalia,>> J., dissenting). The caution that
must be exercised in the incremental development of common-law crimes by
the judiciary is, for the reasons explained in the text, all the more
critical when reviewing developments that stem from military action.


  This high standard was met in \\Quirin;\\ the violation there alleged
was, by “universal agreement and practice” both in this country and
internationally, recognized as an offense against the law of war. 317
U. S., at 30; see \\id.,\\ at 35–36 (“This precept of the law of
war has been so recognized in practice both here and abroad, and has so
generally been accepted as valid by authorities on international law
that we think it must be regarded as a rule or principle of the law of
war recognized by this Government by its enactment of the Fifteenth
Article of War” (footnote omitted)). Although the picture arguably
was less clear in \\Yamashita,\\ compare 327 U. S., at 16 (stating
that the provisions of the Fourth Hague Convention of 1907, 36 Stat.
2306, “plainly” required the defendant to control the troops under
his command), with 327 U. S., at 35 (Murphy, J., dissenting), the
disagreement between the majority and the dissenters in that case
concerned whether the historic and textual evidence constituted clear
precedent—not whether clear precedent was required to justify trial by
law-of-war military commission.

  At a minimum, the Government must make a substantial showing that
the crime for which it seeks to try a defendant by military commission
is acknowledged to be an offense against the law of war. That burden
is far from satisfied here. The crime of “conspiracy” has rarely
if ever been tried as such in this country by any law-of-war military
com@@604@@mission not exercising some other form of jurisdiction,[[35]]
and does not appear in either the Geneva Conventions or the Hague
Conventions—the major treaties on the law of war.[[36]] Winthrop
explains that under the common law governing military commissions, it
is not enough to intend to violate the law of war and commit overt
acts in furtherance of that intention unless the overt acts either
are themselves offenses against the law of war or constitute steps
sufficiently substantial to qualify as an attempt. See Winthrop 841
(“[T]he jurisdiction of the military commission should be restricted
to cases of offence consisting in \\overt acts, i. e.\\ in unlawful
commissions or actual attempts to commit, and not in intentions
merely” (emphasis in original)).

  The Government cites three sources that it says show otherwise. First,
it points out that the Nazi saboteurs in \\Quirin\\ were charged with
conspiracy. See Brief for Respondents 27. Second, it observes that
Winthrop at one @@605@@ point in his treatise identifies conspiracy
as an offense “prosecuted by military commissions.” \\Ibid.\\
(citing Winthrop 839, and n. 5). Finally, it notes that another military
historian, Charles Roscoe Howland, lists conspiracy “ ‘to violate
the laws of war by destroying life or property in aid of the enemy’
” as an offense that was tried as a violation of the law of war during
the Civil War. Brief for Respondents 27–28 (citing C. Howland, Digest
of Opinions of the Judge Advocates General of the Army 1071 (1912)
(hereinafter Howland)). On close analysis, however, these sources at
best lend little support to the Government’s position and at worst
undermine it. By any measure, they fail to satisfy the high standard of
clarity required to justify the use of a military commission.

^35 The 19th-century trial of the “Lincoln conspirators,” even
if properly classified as a trial by law-of-war commission, cf. W.
Rehnquist, All the Laws But One: Civil Liberties in Wartime 165–167
(1998) (analyzing the conspiracy charges in light of ordinary criminal
law principles at the time), is at best an equivocal exception.
Although the charge against the defendants in that case accused them
of “combining, confederating, and conspiring together” to murder
the President, they were also charged (as we read the indictment,
cf. \\post,\\ at 699–700, n. 12 (<<Thomas,>> J., dissenting)),
with “maliciously, unlawfully, and traitorously murdering the said
Abraham Lincoln.” H. R. Doc. No. 314, 55th Cong., 3d Sess., 696
(1899). Moreover, the Attorney General who wrote the opinion defending
the trial by military commission treated the charge as if it alleged
the substantive offense of assassination. See 11 Op. Atty. Gen. 297
(1865) (analyzing the propriety of trying by military commission “the
offence of having assassinated the President”); see also \\Mudd\\ v.
\\Caldera,\\ 134 F. Supp. 2d 138, 140 (DC 2001).

^36 By contrast, the Geneva Conventions do extend liability for
substantive war crimes to those who “orde[r]” their commission,
see Third Geneva Convention, Art. 129, 6 U. S. T., at 3418, and this
Court has read the Fourth Hague Convention of 1907 to impose “command
responsibility” on military commanders for acts of their subordinates,
see \\Yamashita,\\ 327 U. S., at 15–16.

  That the defendants in \\Quirin\\ were charged with conspiracy is not
persuasive, since the Court declined to address whether the offense
actually qualified as a violation of the law of war—let alone one
triable by military commission. The \\Quirin\\ defendants were charged
with the following offenses:

    “[I.] Violation of the law of war.

    “[II.] Violation of Article 81 of the Articles of War, defining
the offense of relieving or attempting to relieve, or corresponding with
or giving intelligence to, the enemy.

    “[III.] Violation of Article 82, defining the offense of spying.

    “[IV.] Conspiracy to commit the offenses alleged in charges [I,
II, and III].” 317 U. S., at 23.

The Government, defending its charge, argued that the conspiracy alleged
“constitute[d] an additional violation of the law of war.” \\Id.,\\
at 15. The saboteurs disagreed; they maintained that “[t]he charge
of conspiracy can not stand if the other charges fall.” \\Id.,\\ at
8. The Court, however, declined to resolve the dispute. It concluded,
first, that the @@606@@ specification supporting Charge I adequately
alleged a “violation of the law of war” that was not “merely
colorable or without foundation.” \\Id.,\\ at 36. The facts the Court
deemed sufficient for this purpose were that the defendants, admitted
enemy combatants, entered upon U. S. territory in time of war without
uniform “for the purpose of destroying property used or useful in
prosecuting the war.” That act was “a hostile and warlike” one.
\\Id.,\\ at 36, 37. The Court was careful in its decision to identify
an overt, “complete” act. Responding to the argument that the
saboteurs had “not actually committed or attempted to commit any
act of depredation or entered the theatre or zone of active military
operations” and therefore had not violated the law of war, the Court
responded that they had actually “passed our military and naval lines
and defenses or went behind those lines, in civilian dress and with
hostile purpose.” \\Id.,\\ at 38. “The offense was complete when
with that purpose they entered— or, having so entered, they remained
upon—our territory in time of war without uniform or other appropriate
means of identification.” \\Ibid.\\

  Turning to the other charges alleged, the Court explained that
“[s]ince the first specification of Charge I sets forth a violation
of the law of war, we have no occasion to pass on the adequacy of
the second specification of Charge I, or to construe the 81st and
82nd Articles of War for the purpose of ascertaining whether the
specifications under Charges II and III allege violations of those
Articles or whether if so construed they are constitutional.” \\Id.,\\
at 46. No mention was made at all of Charge IV—the conspiracy charge.

  If anything, \\Quirin\\ supports Hamdan’s argument that conspiracy
is not a violation of the law of war. Not only did the Court pointedly
omit any discussion of the conspiracy charge, but its analysis of Charge
I placed special emphasis on the \\completion\\ of an offense; it took
seriously the saboteurs’ argument that there can be no violation of a
law of war—at least not one triable by military commission—without
the @@607@@ actual commission of or attempt to commit a “hostile and
warlike act.” \\Id.,\\ at 37–38.

  That limitation makes eminent sense when one considers the necessity
from whence this kind of military commission grew: The need to dispense
swift justice, often in the form of execution, to illegal belligerents
captured on the battlefield. See S. Rep. No. 130, 64th Cong., 1st Sess.,
40 (1916) (testimony of Brig. Gen. Enoch H. Crowder) (observing that
Article of War 15 preserves the power of “the military commander \\in
the field in time of war\\” to use military commissions (emphasis
added)). The same urgency would not have been felt vis-a`-vis enemies
who had done little more than agree to violate the laws of war.
Cf. 31 Op. Atty. Gen. 356, 357, 361 (1918) (opining that a German
spy could not be tried by military commission because, having been
apprehended before entering “any camp, fortification or other military
premises of the United States,” he had “committed [his offenses]
outside of the field of military operations”). The \\Quirin\\ Court
acknowledged as much when it described the President’s authority to
use law-of-war military commissions as the power to “seize and subject
to disciplinary measures those enemies \\who in their attempt to thwart
or impede our military effort\\ have violated the law of war.” 317 U.
S., at 28–29 (emphasis added).

  Winthrop and Howland are only superficially more helpful to the
Government. Howland, granted, lists “conspiracy by two or more to
violate the laws of war by destroying life or property in aid of the
enemy” as one of over 20 “offenses against the laws and usages of
war” “passed upon and punished by military commissions.” Howland
1070–1071. But while the records of cases that Howland cites following
his list of offenses against the law of war support inclusion of the
other offenses mentioned, they provide no support for the inclusion
of conspiracy as a violation of the law of war. See \\id.,\\ at 1071
(citing Record Books of the Judge Advocate General Office, R. 2, 144; R.
3, 401, 589, 649; R. 4, 320; R. 5, @@608@@ 36, 590; R. 6, 20; R. 7, 413;
R. 8, 529; R. 9, 149, 202, 225, 481, 524, 535; R. 10, 567; R. 11, 473,
513; R. 13, 125, 675; R. 16, 446; R. 21, 101, 280). Winthrop, apparently
recognizing as much, excludes conspiracy of any kind from his own list
of offenses against the law of war. See Winthrop 839–840.

  Winthrop does, unsurprisingly, include “criminal conspiracies”
in his list of “[c]rimes and statutory offenses cognizable by State
or U. S. courts” and triable by martial law or military government
commission. See \\id.,\\ at 839. And, in a footnote, he cites several
Civil War examples of “conspiracies of this class, \\or of the first
and second classes combined.\\” \\Id.,\\ at 839, n. 5 (emphasis
added). The Government relies on this footnote for its contention
that conspiracy was triable both as an ordinary crime (a crime of the
“first class”) and, independently, as a war crime (a crime of the
“second class”). But the footnote will not support the weight the
Government places on it.

  As we have seen, the military commissions convened during the Civil
War functioned at once as martial law or military government tribunals
and as law-of-war commissions. See n. 27, \\supra.\\ Accordingly, they
regularly tried war crimes and ordinary crimes together. Indeed, as
Howland observes, “[n]ot unfrequently the crime, as charged and found,
was a combination of the two species of offenses.” Howland 1071;
see also Davis 310, n. 2; Winthrop 842. The example he gives is “
‘murder in violation of the laws of war.’ ” Howland 1071–1072.
Winthrop’s conspiracy “of the first and second classes combined”
is, like Howland’s example, best understood as a species of compound
offense of the type tried by the hybrid military commissions of the
Civil War. It is not a stand-alone offense against the law of war.
Winthrop confirms this understanding later in his discussion, when he
emphasizes that \\“overt acts”\\ constituting war crimes are the
only proper subject at least of those military tribunals not convened
to stand in for local courts. Winthrop 841, and nn. 22, 23 (citing W.
Finlason, Martial Law 130 (1867); emphasis in original). @@609@@

  <<Justice Thomas>> cites as evidence that conspiracy is a recognized
violation of the law of war the Civil War indictment against Henry
Wirz, which charged the defendant with “ ‘[m]aliciously, willfully,
and traitorously . . . combining, confederating, and conspiring [with
others] to injure the health and destroy the lives of soldiers in the
military service of the United States . . . to the end that the armies
of the United States might be weakened and impaired, in violation of the
laws and customs of war.’ ” \\Post,\\ at 701 (dissenting opinion)
(quoting H. R. Doc. No. 314, 55th Cong., 3d Sess., 785 (1899); emphasis

Wirz was alleged to have \\personally committed\\ a number of atrocities
against his victims, including torture, injection of prisoners with
poison, and use of “ferocious and bloodthirsty dogs” to “seize,
tear, mangle, and maim the bodies and limbs” of prisoners, many of
whom died as a result. \\Id.,\\ at 789–790. Crucially, Judge Advocate
General Holt determined that one of Wirz’s alleged co-conspirators, R.
B. Winder, should \\not\\ be tried by military commission because there
was as yet insufficient evidence of his own personal involvement in
the atrocities: “[I]n the case of R. B. Winder, \\while the evidence
at the trial of Wirz was deemed by the court to implicate him in the
conspiracy\\ against the lives of all Federal prisoners in rebel hands,
\\no such specific overt acts of violation of the laws of war\\ are as
yet fixed upon him as to make it expedient to prefer formal charges and
bring him to trial.” \\Id.,\\ at 783 (emphasis added).[[37]] @@610@@

^37 The other examples <<Justice Thomas>> offers are no more availing.
The Civil War indictment against Robert Louden, cited \\post,\\ at 702,
alleged a conspiracy, but not one in violation of the law of war. See
War Dept., General Court Martial Order No. 41, p. 20 (1864). A separate
charge of “ ‘[t]ransgression of the laws and customs of war’ ”
made no mention of conspiracy. \\Id.,\\ at 17. The charge against Leger
Grenfel and others for conspiring to release rebel prisoners held in
Chicago only supports the observation, made in the text, that the Civil
War tribunals often charged hybrid crimes mixing elements of crimes
ordinarily triable in civilian courts (like treason) and violations of
the law of war. Judge Advo@@610@@cate General Holt, in recommending
that Grenfel’s death sentence be upheld (it was in fact commuted by
Presidential decree, see H. R. Doc. No. 314, at 725), explained that
the accused “united himself with traitors and malefactors for the
overthrow of our Republic in the interest of slavery.” \\Id.,\\ at
689.

  Finally, international sources confirm that the crime charged here is
not a recognized violation of the law of war.[[38]] As observed above,
see \\supra,\\ at 603–604, none of the major treaties governing the
law of war identifies conspiracy as a violation thereof. And the only
“conspiracy” crimes that have been recognized by international war
crimes tribunals (whose jurisdiction often extends beyond war crimes
proper to crimes against humanity and crimes against the peace) are
conspiracy to commit genocide and common plan to wage aggressive war,
which is a crime against the peace and requires for its commission
actual participation in a “concrete plan to wage war.” 1 Trial of
the Major War Criminals Before the International Military Tribunal:
Nuremberg, 14 November 1945–1 October 1946, p. 225 (1947) (hereinafter
Trial of Major War Criminals). The International Military Tribunal at
Nuremberg, over the prosecution’s objections, pointedly refused to
recognize as a violation of the law of war conspiracy to commit war
crimes, see, \\e. g.,\\ 22 \\id.,\\ at 469,[[39]] and convicted only
Hitler’s most senior associates of conspiracy to wage aggressive war,
see S. Pomorski, Con@@611@@spiracy and Criminal Organization, in the
Nuremberg Trial and International Law 213, 233–235 (G. Ginsburgs &
V. Kudriavtsev eds. 1990). As one prominent figure from the Nuremberg
trials has explained, members of the Tribunal objected to recognition of
conspiracy as a violation of the law of war on the ground that “[t]he
Anglo-American concept of conspiracy was not part of European legal
systems and arguably not an element of the internationally recognized
laws of war.” T. Taylor, Anatomy of the Nuremberg Trials: A Personal
Memoir 36 (1992); see also \\id.,\\ at 550 (observing that Francis
Biddle, who as Attorney General prosecuted the defendants in \\Quirin,\\
thought the French judge had made a “ ‘persuasive argument that
conspiracy in the truest sense is not known to international law’
”).[[40]]

^38 The Court in \\Quirin\\ “assume[d] that there are acts regarded in
other countries, or by some writers on international law, as offenses
against the law of war which would not be triable by military tribunal
here, either because they are not recognized by our courts as violations
of the law of war or because they are of that class of offenses
constitutionally triable only by a jury.” 317 U. S., at 29. We need
not test the validity of that assumption here because the international
sources only corroborate the domestic ones.

^39 Accordingly, the Tribunal determined to “disregard the charges . .
. that the defendants conspired to commit War Crimes and Crimes against
Humanity.” 22 Trial of Major War Criminals 469; see also \\ibid.\\
(“[T]he Charter does not define as a separate crime any conspiracy
except the one to commit acts of aggressive war”).

  In sum, the sources that the Government and <<Justice Thomas>> rely
upon to show that conspiracy to violate the law of war is itself a
violation of the law of war in fact demonstrate quite the opposite. Far
from making the requisite substantial showing, the Government has failed
even to offer a “merely colorable” case for inclusion of conspiracy
among those offenses cognizable by law-of-war military commission.
Cf. \\Quirin,\\ 317 U. S., at 36. Because the charge does not @@612@@
support the commission’s jurisdiction, the commission lacks authority
to try Hamdan.

^40 See also 15 United Nations War Crimes Commissions, Law Reports of
Trials of War Criminals 90–91 (1949) (observing that, although a
few individuals were charged with conspiracy under European domestic
criminal codes following World War II, “the United States Military
Tribunals” established at that time did not “recognis[e] as a
separate offence conspiracy to commit war crimes or crimes against
humanity”). The International Criminal Tribunal for the former
Yugoslavia (ICTY), drawing on the Nuremberg precedents, has adopted
a “joint criminal enterprise” theory of liability, but that is a
species of liability for the substantive offense (akin to aiding and
abetting), not a crime on its own. See \\Prosecutor\\ v. \\Tadic´,\\
Judgment, Case No. IT–94–1–A (ICTY App. Chamber, July 15, 1999);
see also \\Prosecutor\\ v. \\Milutinovic´,\\ Decision on Dragoljub
Ojdanic´ ’s Motion Challenging Jurisdiction—Joint Criminal
Enterprise, Case No. IT–99–37–AR72, ¶ 26 (ICTY App. Chamber, May
21, 2003) (stating that “[c]riminal liability pursuant to a joint
criminal enterprise is not a liability for. . . conspiring to commit
crimes”).

  The charge’s shortcomings are not merely formal, but are indicative
of a broader inability on the Executive’s part here to satisfy
the most basic precondition—at least in the absence of specific
congressional authorization—for establishment of military commissions:
military necessity. Hamdan’s tribunal was appointed not by a military
commander in the field of battle, but by a retired major general
stationed away from any active hostilities. Cf. \\Rasul\\ v. \\Bush,\\
542 U. S., at 487 (<<Kennedy,>> J., concurring in judgment) (observing
that “Guantanamo Bay is. . . far removed from any hostilities”).
Hamdan is charged not with an overt act for which he was caught
redhanded in a theater of war and which military efficiency demands be
tried expeditiously, but with an \\agreement\\ the inception of which
long predated the attacks of September 11, 2001, and the AUMF. That may
well be a crime,[[41]] but it is not an offense that “by the law of
war may be tried by military commissio[n].” 10 U. S. C. § 821.
None of the overt acts alleged to have been committed in furtherance
of the agreement is itself a war crime, or even necessarily occurred
during time of, or in a theater of, war. Any urgent need for imposition
or execution of judgment is utterly belied by the record; Hamdan was
arrested in November 2001 and he was not charged until mid-2004. These
simply are not the circumstances in which, by any stretch of the
historical evidence or this Court’s precedents, a military commission
established by Executive Order under the au@@613@@thority of Article 21
of the UCMJ may lawfully try a person and subject him to punishment.

^41 <<Justice Thomas’>> suggestion that our conclusion precludes the
Government from bringing to justice those who conspire to commit acts
of terrorism is therefore wide of the mark. See \\post,\\ at 686, n.
3, 704–706. That conspiracy is not a violation of the law of war
triable by military commission does not mean the Government may not,
for example, prosecute by court-martial or in federal court those
caught “plotting terrorist atrocities like the bombing of the Khobar
Towers.” \\Post,\\ at 705.

# VI

  Whether or not the Government has charged Hamdan with an offense
against the law of war cognizable by military commission, the commission
lacks power to proceed. The UCMJ conditions the President’s use of
military commissions on compliance not only with the American common
law of war, but also with the rest of the UCMJ itself, insofar as
applicable, and with the “rules and precepts of the law of nations,”
\\Quirin,\\ 317 U. S., at 28—including, \\inter alia,\\ the four
Geneva Conventions signed in 1949. See \\Yamashita,\\ 327 U. S., at
20–21, 23–24. The procedures that the Government has decreed will
govern Hamdan’s trial by commission violate these laws.

## A

  The commission’s procedures are set forth in Commission Order
No. 1, which was amended most recently on August 31, 2005—after
Hamdan’s trial had already begun. Every commission established
pursuant to Commission Order No. 1 must have a presiding officer and at
least three other members, all of whom must be commissioned officers.
§ 4(A)(1). The presiding officer’s job is to rule on questions of
law and other evidentiary and interlocutory issues; the other members
make findings and, if applicable, sentencing decisions. § 4(A)(5).
The accused is entitled to appointed military counsel and may hire
civilian counsel at his own expense so long as such counsel is a U. S.
citizen with security clearance “at the level SECRET or higher.”
§§ 4(C)(2)–(3).

  The accused also is entitled to a copy of the charge(s) against him,
both in English and his own language (if different), to a presumption
of innocence, and to certain other rights typically afforded criminal
defendants in civilian courts and courts-martial. See §§ 5(A)–(P).
These rights @@614@@ are subject, however, to one glaring condition: The
accused and his civilian counsel may be excluded from, and precluded
from ever learning what evidence was presented during, any part of
the proceeding that either the Appointing Authority or the presiding
officer decides to “close.” Grounds for such closure “include the
protection of information classified or classifiable. . .;information
protected by law or rule from unauthorized disclosure; the physical
safety of participants in Commission proceedings, including prospective
witnesses; intelligence and law enforcement sources, methods, or
activities; and other national security interests.” § 6(B)(3).[[42]]
Appointed military defense counsel must be privy to these closed
sessions, but may, at the presiding officer’s discretion, be forbidden
to reveal to his or her client what took place therein. \\Ibid.\\

  Another striking feature of the rules governing Hamdan’s commission
is that they permit the admission of \\any\\ evidence that, in the
opinion of the presiding officer, “would have probative value to
a reasonable person.” § 6(D)(1). Under this test, not only is
testimonial hearsay and evidence obtained through coercion fully
admissible, but neither live testimony nor witnesses’ written
statements need be sworn. See §§ 6(D)(2)(b), (3). Moreover, the
accused and his civilian counsel may be denied access to evidence in
the form of “protected information” (which includes classified
information as well as “information protected by law or rule from
unauthorized disclosure” and “information concerning other national
security interests,” §§ 6(B)(3), 6(D)(5)(a)(v)), so long as the
presiding officer concludes that the evidence is “probative”
under § 6(D)(1) and that its admission without the accused’s
knowledge would not “result in the denial of a full and fair
trial.” § 6(D)(5)(b).[[43]] Finally, a presiding officer’s
determi@@615@@nation that evidence “would [not] have probative value
to a reasonable person” may be overridden by a majority of the other
commission members. § 6(D)(1).

^42 The accused also may be excluded from the proceedings if he
“engages in disruptive conduct.” § 5(K).

^43 As the District Court observed, this section apparently permits
reception of testimony from a confidential informant in circumstances
where @@615@@ “Hamdan will not be permitted to hear the testimony,
see the witness’s face, or learn his name. If the government has
information developed by interrogation of witnesses in Afghanistan or
elsewhere, it can offer such evidence in transcript form, or even as
summaries of transcripts.” 344 F. Supp. 2d 152, 168 (DC 2004).

  Once all the evidence is in, the commission members (not including
the presiding officer) must vote on the accused’s guilt. A two-thirds
vote will suffice for both a verdict of guilty and for imposition of
any sentence not including death (the imposition of which requires
a unanimous vote). § 6(F). Any appeal is taken to a three-member
review panel composed of military officers and designated by the
Secretary of Defense, only one member of which need have experience
as a judge. § 6(H)(4). The review panel is directed to “disregard
any variance from procedures specified in this Order or elsewhere that
would not materially have affected the outcome of the trial before
the Commission.” \\Ibid.\\ Once the panel makes its recommendation
to the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary can either remand for
further proceedings or forward the record to the President with his
recommendation as to final disposition. § 6(H)(5). The President then,
unless he has delegated the task to the Secretary, makes the “final
decision.” § 6(H)(6). He may change the commission’s findings or
sentence only in a manner favorable to the accused. \\Ibid.\\

## B

  Hamdan raises both general and particular objections to the procedures
set forth in Commission Order No. 1. His general objection is that the
procedures’ admitted deviation from those governing courts-martial
itself renders the commission illegal. Chief among his particular
objections are that he may, under the Commission Order, be convicted
@@616@@ based on evidence he has not seen or heard, and that any
evidence admitted against him need not comply with the admissibility
or relevance rules typically applicable in criminal trials and
court-martial proceedings.

  The Government objects to our consideration of any procedural
challenge at this stage on the grounds that (1) the abstention doctrine
espoused in \\Councilman,\\ 420 U. S. 738, precludes preenforcement
review of procedural rules, (2) Hamdan will be able to raise any
such challenge following a “final decision” under the DTA, and
(3) “there is . . . no basis to presume, before the trial has even
commenced, that the trial will not be conducted in good faith and
according to law.” Brief for Respondents 45–46, nn. 20–21. The
first of these contentions was disposed of in Part III, \\supra,\\ and
neither of the latter two is sound.

  First, because Hamdan apparently is not subject to the death penalty
(at least as matters now stand) and may receive a sentence shorter than
10 years’ imprisonment, he has no automatic right to review of the
commission’s “final decision”[[44]] before a federal court under
the DTA. See § 1005(e)(3), 119 Stat. 2743. Second, contrary to the
Government’s assertion, there \\is\\ a “basis to presume” that
the procedures employed during Hamdan’s trial will violate the law:
The procedures are described with particularity in Commission Order
No. 1, and implementation of some of them has already occurred. One
of Hamdan’s complaints is that he will be, and \\indeed already has
been,\\ excluded from his own trial. See Reply Brief for Petitioner
12; App. to Pet. for Cert. 45a. Under these circumstances, review
of the procedures in advance of a “final decision”—the timing
of which is left entirely to the discretion of the President under
the DTA—is appropriate. We turn, then, to consider the merits of
Hamdan’s procedural challenge. @@617@@

^44 Any decision of the commission is not “final” until the
President renders it so. See Commission Order No. 1, § 6(H)(6).

## C

  In part because the difference between military commissions and
courts-martial originally was a difference of jurisdiction alone, and
in part to protect against abuse and ensure evenhandedness under the
pressures of war, the procedures governing trials by military commission
historically have been the same as those governing courts-martial. See,
\\e. g.,\\ 1 The War of the Rebellion 248 (2d series 1894) (General
Order 1 issued during the Civil War required military commissions to
“be constituted in a similar manner and their proceedings be conducted
according to the same general rules as courts-martial in order to
prevent abuses which might otherwise arise”). Accounts of commentators
from Winthrop through General Crowder—who drafted Article of War 15
and whose views have been deemed “authoritative” by this Court,
\\Madsen,\\ 343 U. S., at 353—confirm as much.[[45]] As recently as
the Korean and Vietnam wars, during which use of military commissions
was contemplated but never made, the principle of procedural parity was
espoused as a background assumption. See Paust, Antiterrorism Military
Commissions: Courting Illegality, 23 Mich. J. Int’l L. 1, 3–5
(2001–2002).

  There is a glaring historical exception to this general rule. The
procedures and evidentiary rules used to try General Yamashita near the
end of World War II deviated in significant respects from those then
governing courts-martial. @@618@@ See 327 U. S. 1. The force of that
precedent, however, has been seriously undermined by post-World War II
developments.

^45 See Winthrop 835, and n. 81 (“military commissions are constituted
and composed, and their proceedings are conducted, similarly to general
courts-martial”); \\id.,\\ at 841–842; S. Rep. No. 130, 64th
Cong., 1st Sess., 40 (1916) (testimony of Gen. Crowder) (“Both
classes of courts have the same procedure”); see also, \\e. g.,\\
H. Coppe´e, Field Manual of Courts-Martial 105 (1863) (“[Military]
commissions are appointed by the same authorities as those which may
order courts-martial. They are constituted in a manner similar to such
courts, and their proceedings are conducted in exactly the same way, as
to form, examination of witnesses, etc.”).

  Yamashita, from late 1944 until September 1945, was Commanding General
of the Fourteenth Army Group of the Imperial Japanese Army, which had
exercised control over the Philippine Islands. On September 3, 1945,
after American forces regained control of the Philippines, Yamashita
surrendered. Three weeks later, he was charged with violations of the
law of war. A few weeks after that, he was arraigned before a military
commission convened in the Philippines. He pleaded not guilty, and
his trial lasted for two months. On December 7, 1945, Yamashita was
convicted and sentenced to hang. See \\id.,\\ at 5; \\id.,\\ at 31–34
(Murphy, J., dissenting). This Court upheld the denial of his petition
for a writ of habeas corpus.

  The procedures and rules of evidence employed during Yamashita’s
trial departed so far from those used in courts-martial that they
generated an unusually long and vociferous critique from two Members of
this Court. See \\id.,\\ at 41–81 (Rutledge, J., joined by Murphy,
J., dissenting).[[46]] Among the dissenters’ primary concerns was
that the commission had free rein to consider all evidence “which
in the commission’s opinion ‘would be of assistance in proving
or disproving the charge,’ without any of the usual modes of
authentication.” \\Id.,\\ at 49 (opinion of Rutledge, J.). @@619@@

^46 The dissenters’ views are summarized in the following passage:

  ^ “It is outside our basic scheme to condemn men without giving
reasonable opportunity for preparing defense; in capital or other
serious crimes to convict on ‘official documents. . .; affidavits;. . .
documents or translations thereof; diaries . . . , photographs, motion
picture films, and . . . newspapers’ or on hearsay, once, twice or
thrice removed, more particularly when the documentary evidence or some
of it is prepared \\ex parte\\ by the prosecuting authority and includes
not only opinion but conclusions of guilt. Nor in such cases do we deny
the rights of confrontation of witnesses and cross-examination.”
\\Yamashita,\\ 327 U. S., at 44 (footnotes omitted).

  The majority, however, did not pass on the merits of Yamashita’s
procedural challenges because it concluded that his status disentitled
him to any protection under the Articles of War (specifically, those
set forth in Article 38, which would become Article 36 of the UCMJ) or
the Geneva Convention of 1929, 47 Stat. 2021 (1929 Geneva Convention).
The Court explained that Yamashita was neither a “person made subject
to the Articles of War by Article 2” thereof, 327 U. S., at 20, nor a
protected prisoner of war being tried for crimes committed during his
detention, \\id.,\\ at 21.

  At least partially in response to subsequent criticism of General
Yamashita’s trial, the UCMJ’s codification of the Articles of War
after World War II expanded the category of persons subject thereto to
include defendants in Yamashita’s (and Hamdan’s) position,[[47]] and
the Third Geneva Convention of 1949 extended prisoner-of-war protections
to individuals tried for crimes committed before their capture. See
3 Int’l Comm. of Red Cross,[[48]] Commentary: Geneva Convention
Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War 413 (J. Pictet gen. ed.
1960) (hereinafter GCIII Commentary) (explaining @@620@@ that Article
85, which extends the Convention’s protections to “[p]risoners of
war prosecuted under the laws of the Detaining Power for acts committed
prior to capture,” was adopted in response to judicial interpretations
of the 1929 Geneva Convention, including this Court’s decision in
\\Yamashita\\). The most notorious exception to the principle of
uniformity, then, has been stripped of its precedential value.

^47 Article 2 of the UCMJ now reads:

  ^ “(a) The following persons are subject to [the UCMJ]:

  ^ . . . . .

  ^ “(9) Prisoners of war in custody of the armed forces.

  ^ . . . . .

  ^ “(12) Subject to any treaty or agreement to which the United
States is or may be a party or to any accepted rule of international
law, persons within an area leased by or otherwise reserved or acquired

Secretary concerned and which is outside the United States and outside
the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Virgin Islands.” 10
U. S. C. § 802(a).

  ^ Guantanamo Bay is such a leased area. See \\Rasul\\ v. \\Bush,\\ 542
U. S. 466, 471 (2004).

^48 The International Committee of the Red Cross is referred to by name
in several provisions of the 1949 Geneva Conventions and is the body
that drafted and published the official commentary to the Conventions.
Though not binding law, the commentary is, as the parties recognize,
relevant in interpreting the Conventions’ provisions.

  The uniformity principle is not an inflexible one; it does not
preclude all departures from the procedures dictated for use by
courts-martial. But any departure must be tailored to the exigency
that necessitates it. See Winthrop 835, n. 81. That understanding is
reflected in Article 36 of the UCMJ, which provides:

      “(a) The procedure, including modes of proof, in cases before
courts-martial, courts of inquiry, military commissions, and other
military tribunals may be prescribed by the President by regulations
which shall, so far as he considers practicable, apply the principles
of law and the rules of evidence generally recognized in the trial of
criminal cases in the United States district courts, but which may not
be contrary to or inconsistent with this chapter.

      “(b) All rules and regulations made under this article shall be
uniform insofar as practicable and shall be reported to Congress.” 70A
Stat. 50.

  Article 36 places two restrictions on the President’s power
to promulgate rules of procedure for courts-martial and military
commissions alike. First, no procedural rule he adopts may be
“contrary to or inconsistent with” the UCMJ—however practical
it may seem. Second, the rules adopted must be “uniform insofar as
practicable.” That is, the rules applied to military commissions must
be the same as those applied to courts-martial unless such uniformity
proves impracticable. @@621@@

  Hamdan argues that Commission Order No. 1 violates both of these
restrictions; he maintains that the procedures described in the
Commission Order are inconsistent with the UCMJ and that the Government
has offered no explanation for their deviation from the procedures
governing courts-martial, which are set forth in the Manual for Courts-
Martial, United States (2005 ed.) (Manual for Courts- Martial).
Among the inconsistencies Hamdan identifies is that between § 6
of the Commission Order, which permits exclusion of the accused
from proceedings and denial of his access to evidence in certain
circumstances, and the UCMJ’s requirement that “[a]ll . . .
proceedings” other than votes and deliberations by courts-martial
“shall be made a part of the record and shall be in the presence of
the accused.” 10 U. S. C. § 839(c) (2000 ed., Supp. V). Hamdan
also observes that the Commission Order dispenses with virtually all
evidentiary rules applicable in courts-martial.

  The Government has three responses. First, it argues, only 9 of the
UCMJ’s 158 Articles—the ones that expressly mention “military
commissions”[[49]]—actually apply to commissions, and Commission
Order No. 1 sets forth no pro@@622@@cedure that is “contrary to
or inconsistent with” those 9 provisions. Second, the Government
contends, military commissions would be of no use if the President were
hamstrung by those provisions of the UCMJ that govern courts-martial.
Finally, the President’s determination that “the danger to the
safety of the United States and the nature of international terrorism”
renders it impracticable “to apply in military commissions . . . the
principles of law and the rules of evidence generally recognized in
the trial of criminal cases in the United States district courts,”
November 13 Order §1(f), is, in the Government’s view, explanation
enough for any deviation from court-martial procedures. See Brief for
Respondents 43–47, and n. 22.

^49 Aside from Articles 21 and 36, discussed at length in the text,
the other seven Articles that expressly reference military commissions
are: (1) 28 (requiring appointment of reporters and interpreters);
(2) 47 (making it a crime to refuse to appear or testify “before a
court-martial, military commission, court of inquiry, or any other
military court or board”); (3) 48 (allowing a “court-martial,
provost court, or military commission” to punish a person for
contempt); (4) 49(d) (permitting admission into evidence of a “duly
authenticated deposition taken upon reasonable notice to the other
parties” \\only\\ if “admissible under the rules of evidence” and
\\only\\ if the witness is otherwise unavailable); (5) 50 (permitting
admission into evidence of records of courts of inquiry “if otherwise
admissible under the rules of evidence,” and if certain other
requirements are met); (6) 104 (providing that a person accused of
aiding the enemy may be sentenced to death or other punishment by
military commission or court-martial); and (7) 106 (mandating the
death penalty for spies convicted before military commission or
court-martial).

  Hamdan has the better of this argument. Without reaching the question
whether any provision of Commission Order No. 1 is strictly “contrary
to or inconsistent with” other provisions of the UCMJ, we conclude
that the “practicability” determination the President has made
is insufficient to justify variances from the procedures governing
courts-martial. Subsection (b) of Article 36 was added after World War
II, and requires a different showing of impracticability from the one
required by subsection (a). Subsection (a) requires that the rules
the President promulgates for courts-martial, provost courts, and
military commissions alike conform to those that govern procedures in
\\Article III courts,\\ “so far as \\he considers\\ practicable.”
10 U. S. C. § 836(a) (emphasis added). Subsection (b), by contrast,
demands that the rules applied in courts-martial, provost courts, and
military commissions—whether or not they conform with the Federal
Rules of Evidence—be “uniform \\insofar as practicable.\\”
§ 836(b) (emphasis added). Under the latter provision, then, the
rules set forth in the Manual for Courts-Martial must apply to military
commissions unless impracticable.[[50]] @@623@@

^50 <<Justice Thomas>> relies on the legislative history of the UCMJ to
argue that Congress’ adoption of Article 36(b) in the wake of World
War II was “motivated” solely by a desire for “uniformity across
the separate branches of the armed services.” \\Post,\\ at 711. But
even if Congress was @@623@@ concerned with ensuring uniformity across
service branches, that does not mean it did not also intend to codify
the longstanding practice of procedural parity between courts-martial
and other military tribunals. Indeed, the suggestion that Congress
did \\not\\ intend uniformity across tribunal types is belied by the
textual proximity of subsection (a) (which requires that the rules
governing criminal trials in federal district courts apply, absent the
President’s determination of impracticability, to courts-martial,
provost courts, and \\military commissions\\ alike) and subsection (b)
(which imposes the uniformity requirement).

  The President here has determined, pursuant to subsection (a), that
it is impracticable to apply the rules and principles of law that
govern “the trial of criminal cases in the United States district
courts,” § 836(a), to Hamdan’s commission. We assume that complete
deference is owed that determination. The President has not, however,
made a similar official determination that it is impracticable to apply
the rules for courts-martial.[[51]] And even if subsection (b)’s
requirements may be satisfied without such an official determination,
the requirements of that subsection are not satisfied here.

  Nothing in the record before us demonstrates that it would be
impracticable to apply court-martial rules in this case. There is no
suggestion, for example, of any logistical difficulty in securing
properly sworn and authenticated evidence or in applying the usual
principles of relevance and admissibility. Assuming, \\arguendo,\\
that the reasons articulated in the President’s Article 36(a)
determination ought to be considered in evaluating the impracticability
of applying courtmartial rules, the only reason offered in support of
that determination is the danger posed by international terrorism.[[52]]
@@624@@ Without for one moment underestimating that danger, it is not
evident to us why it should require, in the case of Hamdan’s trial,
any variance from the rules that govern courts-martial.

^51 We may assume that such a determination would be entitled to a
measure of deference. For the reasons given by <<Justice Kennedy,>>
see \\post,\\ at 640 (opinion concurring in part), however, the level
of deference accorded to a determination made under subsection (b)
presumably would not be as high as that accorded to a determination
under subsection (a).

^52 <<Justice Thomas>> looks not to the President’s official Article
36(a) determination, but instead to press statements made by the
Secretary of Defense and the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy. See
\\post,\\ at 712–713 (dissenting opinion). We have not heretofore,
in evaluating the @@624@@ legality of executive action, deferred to
comments made by such officials to the media. Moreover, the only
additional reason the comments provide—aside from the general danger
posed by international terrorism— for departures from court-martial
procedures is the need to protect classified information. As we explain
in the text, and as <<Justice Kennedy>> elaborates in his separate
opinion, the structural and procedural defects of Hamdan’s commission
extend far beyond rules preventing access to classified information.

  The absence of any showing of impracticability is particularly
disturbing when considered in light of the clear and admitted failure to
apply one of the most fundamental protections afforded not just by the
Manual for Courts-Martial but also by the UCMJ itself: the right to be
present. See 10 U. S. C. § 839(c) (2000 ed., Supp. V). Whether or
not that departure technically is “contrary to or inconsistent with”
the terms of the UCMJ, 10 U. S. C. §836(a), the jettisoning of so
basic a right cannot lightly be excused as “practicable.”

  Under the circumstances, then, the rules applicable in courts-martial
must apply. Since it is undisputed that Commission Order No. 1 deviates
in many significant respects from those rules, it necessarily violates
Article 36(b).

  The Government’s objection that requiring compliance with the
court-martial rules imposes an undue burden both ignores the plain
meaning of Article 36(b) and misunderstands the purpose and the history
of military commissions. The military commission was not born of a
desire to dispense a more summary form of justice than is afforded by
courts-martial; it developed, rather, as a tribunal of necessity to
be employed when courts-martial lacked jurisdiction over either the
accused or the subject matter. See Winthrop 831. Exigency lent the
commission its legitimacy, but did not further justify the wholesale
jettisoning of procedural protections. @@625@@ That history explains why
the military commission’s procedures typically have been the ones used
by courts-martial. That the jurisdiction of the two tribunals today may
sometimes overlap, see \\Madsen,\\ 343 U. S., at 354, does not detract
from the force of this history;[[53]] Article 21 did not transform
the military commission from a tribunal of true exigency into a more
convenient adjudicatory tool. Article 36, confirming as much, strikes a
careful balance between uniform procedure and the need to accommodate
exigencies that may sometimes arise in a theater of war. That Article
not having been complied with here, the rules specified for Hamdan’s
trial are illegal.[[54]]

## D

  The procedures adopted to try Hamdan also violate the Geneva
Conventions. The Court of Appeals dismissed Hamdan’s Geneva Convention
challenge on three independent grounds: (1) the Geneva Conventions are
not judicially enforceable; (2) Hamdan in any event is not entitled to
their protections; and (3) even if he is entitled to their protections,
\\Councilman\\ abstention is appropriate. Judge Williams, concurring,
rejected the second ground but agreed with the @@626@@ majority
respecting the first and the last. As we explained in Part III,
\\supra,\\ the abstention rule applied in \\Councilman,\\ 420 U. S.
738, is not applicable here.[[55]] And for the reasons that follow, we
hold that neither of the other grounds the Court of Appeals gave for its
decision is persuasive.

^53 <<Justice Thomas>> relies extensively on \\Madsen\\ for the
proposition that the President has free rein to set the procedures
that govern military commissions. See \\post,\\ at 706–707, 709, n.
16, 710, and 721. That reliance is misplaced. Not only did \\Madsen\\
not involve a law-of-war military commission, but (1) the petitioner
there did not challenge the procedures used to try her, (2) the UCMJ,
with its new Article 36(b), did not become effective until May 31,
1951, \\after\\ the petitioner’s trial, see 343 U. S., at 345, n. 6,
and (3) the procedures used to try the petitioner actually afforded
\\more\\ protection than those used in courts-martial, see \\id.,\\
at 358–360; see also \\id.,\\ at 358 (“[T]he Military Government
Courts for Germany . . . have had a less military character than that of
courts-martial”).

^54 <<P>>rior to the enactment of Article 36(b), it may well have been
the case that a deviation from the rules governing courts-martial would
not have rendered the military commission “ ‘\\illegal.\\’”
\\Post,\\ at 707, n. 15 (<<Thomas,>> J., dissenting) (quoting Winthrop

  The Court of Appeals relied on \\Johnson\\ v. \\Eisentrager,\\ 339
U. S. 763 (1950), to hold that Hamdan could not invoke the Geneva
Conventions to challenge the Government’s plan to prosecute him in
accordance with Commission Order No. 1. \\Eisentrager\\ involved a
challenge by 21 German nationals to their 1945 convictions for war
crimes by a military tribunal convened in Nanking, China, and to their
subsequent imprisonment in occupied Germany. The petitioners argued,
\\inter alia,\\ that the 1929 Geneva Convention rendered illegal some of
the procedures employed during their trials, which they said deviated
impermissibly from the procedures used by courts-martial to try American
soldiers. See \\id.,\\ at 789. We rejected that claim on the merits
because the petitioners (unlike Hamdan here) had failed to identify any
prejudicial disparity “between the Commission that tried [them] and
those that would try an offending soldier of the American forces of like
rank,” and in any event could claim no protection, under the 1929
Geneva Convention, during trials for crimes that occurred before their
confinement as prisoners of war. \\Id.,\\ at 790.[[56]] @@627@@

^55 <<Justice Thomas>> makes the different argument that Hamdan’s
Geneva Convention challenge is not yet “ripe” because he has yet to
be sentenced. See \\post,\\ at 719–720. This is really just a species
of the abstention argument we have already rejected. See Part III,
\\supra.\\ The text of the Geneva Conventions does not direct an accused
to wait until sentence is imposed to challenge the legality of the
tribunal that is to try him.

^56 As explained in Part VI–C, \\supra,\\ that is no longer true under
the 1949 Conventions.

  Buried in a footnote of the opinion, however, is this curious
statement suggesting that the Court lacked power even to consider the
merits of the Geneva Convention argument:

    “We are not holding that these prisoners have no right which
the military authorities are bound to respect. The United States, by
the Geneva Convention of July 27, 1929, 47 Stat. 2021, concluded with
forty-six other countries, including the German Reich, an agreement
upon the treatment to be accorded captives. These prisoners claim to be
and are entitled to its protection. It is, however, the obvious scheme
of the Agreement that responsibility for observance and enforcement
of these rights is upon political and military authorities. Rights
of alien enemies are vindicated under it only through protests and
intervention of protecting powers as the rights of our citizens against
foreign governments are vindicated only by Presidential intervention.”
\\Id.,\\ at 789, n. 14.

The Court of Appeals, on the strength of this footnote, held that “the
1949 Geneva Convention does not confer upon Hamdan a right to enforce
its provisions in court.” 415 F. 3d, at 40.

  Whatever else might be said about the \\Eisentrager\\ footnote, it
does not control this case. We may assume that “the obvious scheme”
of the 1949 Conventions is identical in all relevant respects to that
of the 1929 Geneva Convention,[[57]] and even that that scheme would,
absent some other provision of law, preclude Hamdan’s invocation of
the Convention’s provisions as an independent source of law binding
the Gov@@628@@ernment’s actions and furnishing petitioner with any
enforceable right.[[58]] For, regardless of the nature of the rights
conferred on Hamdan, cf. \\United States\\ v. \\Rauscher,\\ 119 U. S.
407 (1886), they are, as the Government does not dispute, part of the
law of war. See \\Hamdi,\\ 542 U. S., at 520–521 (plurality opinion).
And compliance with the law of war is the condition upon which the
authority set forth in Article 21 is granted.

^57 But see, \\e. g.,\\ 4 Int’l Comm. of Red Cross, Commentary:
Geneva Convention Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in
Time of War 21 (J. Pictet gen. ed. 1958) (hereinafter GCIV Commentary)
(the 1949 Geneva Conventions were written “first and foremost to
protect individuals, and not to serve State interests”); GCIII
Commentary 91 (“It was not . . . until the Conventions of 1949 . . .
that the existence of ‘rights’ conferred on prisoners of war was
affirmed”).

        ii

  For the Court of Appeals, acknowledgment of that condition was no bar
to Hamdan’s trial by commission. As an alternative to its holding
that Hamdan could not invoke the Geneva Conventions at all, the Court
of Appeals concluded that the Conventions did not in any event apply to
the armed conflict during which Hamdan was captured. The court accepted
the Executive’s assertions that Hamdan was captured in connection with
the United States’ war with al Qaeda and that that war is distinct
from the war with the Taliban in Afghanistan. It further reasoned that
the war with al Qaeda evades the reach of the Geneva Conventions. See
415 F. 3d, at 41–42. We, like Judge Williams, disagree with the latter
conclusion.

  The conflict with al Qaeda is not, according to the Government, a
conflict to which the full protections afforded detainees under the 1949
Geneva Conventions apply because Article 2 of those Conventions (which
appears in all four Conventions) renders the full protections applicable
only to “all cases of declared war or of any other armed conflict
which may arise between two or more of the High Contract@@629@@ing
Parties.” 6 U. S. T., at 3318.[[59]] Since Hamdan was captured
and detained incident to the conflict with al Qaeda and not the
conflict with the Taliban, and since al Qaeda, unlike Afghanistan, is
not a “High Contracting Party”—\\i. e.,\\ a signatory of the
Conventions, the protections of those Conventions are not, it is argued,
applicable to Hamdan.[[60]]

^58 But see generally Brief for Louis Henkin et al. as \\Amici Curiae;\\
1 Int’l Comm. of Red Cross, Commentary: Geneva Convention for the
Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armed Forces
in the Field 84 (1952) (“It should be possible in States which are
parties to the Convention . . . for the rules of the Convention . . . to
be evoked before an appropriate national court by the protected person
who has suffered the violation”); GCIII Commentary 92; GCIV Commentary
79.

  We need not decide the merits of this argument because there is at
least one provision of the Geneva Conventions that applies here even
if the relevant conflict is not one between signatories.[[61]] Article
3, often referred to as Common Article 3 because, like Article 2, it
appears in all four Geneva Conventions, provides that in a “conflict
not of an international character occurring in the territory of one
of the High Contracting Parties, each Party[ [[62]] ] to the conflict
shall be bound to apply, as a minimum,” certain provisions protecting
“[p]ersons taking no active part in the hostilities, including
@@630@@ members of armed forces who have laid down their arms and
those placed \\hors de combat\\ by . . . detention.” \\Ibid.\\ One
such provision prohibits “the passing of sentences and the carrying
out of executions without previous judgment pronounced by a regularly
constituted court affording all the judicial guarantees which are
recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples.” \\Id.,\\ at 3320.

^59 For convenience’s sake, we use citations to the Third Geneva
Convention only.

^60 The President has stated that the conflict with the
Taliban is a conflict to which the Geneva Conventions apply.
See White House Memorandum, Humane Treatment of Taliban
and al Qaeda Detainees 2 (Feb. 7, 2002), available at
http://www.justicescholars.org/pegc/archive/White_House/
bush_memo_20020207_ed.pdf.

^61 Hamdan observes that Article 5 of the Third Geneva Convention
requires that if there be “any doubt” whether he is entitled to
prisoner-of-war protections, he must be afforded those protections until
his status is determined by a “competent tribunal.” 6 U. S. T.,
at 3324. See also Headquarters Depts. of Army, Navy, Air Force, and
Marine Corps, Army Regulation 190–8, Enemy Prisoners of War, Retained
Personnel, Civilian Internees and Other Detainees (1997), App. 116.
Because we hold that Hamdan may not, in any event, be tried by the
military commission the President has convened pursuant to the November
13 Order and Commission Order No. 1, the question whether his potential
status as a prisoner of war independently renders illegal his trial by
military commission may be reserved.

^62 The term “Party” here has the broadest possible meaning; a Party
need neither be a signatory of the Convention nor “even represent a
legal entity capable of undertaking international obligations.” GCIII
Commentary 37.

  The Court of Appeals thought, and the Government asserts, that
Common Article 3 does not apply to Hamdan because the conflict with al
Qaeda, being “ ‘international in scope,’ ” does not qualify
as a “ ‘conflict not of an international character.’ ” 415 F.
3d, at 41. That reasoning is erroneous. The term “conflict not of
an international character” is used here in contradistinction to a
conflict between nations. So much is demonstrated by the “fundamental
logic [of] the Convention’s provisions on its application.” \\Id.,\\
at 44 (Williams, J., concurring). Common Article 2 provides that
“the present Convention shall apply to all cases of declared war
or of any other armed conflict which may arise between two or more
of the High Contracting Parties.” 6 U. S. T., at 3318 (Art. 2, ¶
1). High Contracting Parties (signatories) also must abide by all
terms of the Conventions vis-a`-vis one another even if one party
to the conflict is a nonsignatory “Power,” and must so abide
vis-a`-vis the nonsignatory if “the latter accepts and applies”
those terms. \\Ibid.\\ (Art. 2, ¶ 3). Common Article 3, by contrast,
affords some minimal protection, falling short of full protection under
the Conventions, to individuals associated with neither a signatory
nor even a nonsignatory “Power” who are involved in a conflict
“in the territory of” a signatory. The latter kind of conflict is
distinguishable from the conflict described in Common Article 2 chiefly
because it does not involve a clash between nations (whether signatories
or not). In context, then, the phrase “not of an international
character” bears its literal meaning. See, \\e. g.,\\ J. Bentham,
Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation 6, 296 (J.
@@631@@ Burns & H. Hart eds. 1970) (using the term “international
law” as a “new though not inexpressive appellation” meaning
“betwixt nation and nation”; defining “international” to include
“mutual transactions between sovereigns as such”); Int’l Comm.
of Red Cross, Commentary on the Additional Protocols to the Geneva
Conventions of 12 August 1949, p. 1351 (1987) (“[A] non-international
armed conflict is distinct from an international armed conflict because
of the legal status of the entities opposing each other”).

  Although the official commentaries accompanying Common Article 3
indicate that an important purpose of the provision was to furnish
minimal protection to rebels involved in one kind of “conflict not
of an international character,” \\i. e.,\\ a civil war, see GCIII
Commentary 36–37, the commentaries also make clear “that the scope
of application of the Article must be as wide as possible,” \\id.,\\
at 36.[[63]] In fact, limiting language that would have rendered Common
Article 3 applicable “especially [to] cases of civil war, colonial
conflicts, or wars of religion” was omitted from the final version of
the Article, which coupled broader scope of application with a narrower
range of rights than did earlier proposed iterations. See \\id.,\\ at
42–43.

        iii

  Common Article 3, then, is applicable here and, as indicated above,
requires that Hamdan be tried by a “regularly @@632@@ constituted
court affording all the judicial guarantees which are recognized as
indispensable by civilized peoples.” 6 U. S. T., at 3320 (Art. 3,
¶ 1\\(d)\\). While the term “regularly constituted court” is not
specifically defined in either Common Article 3 or its accompanying
commentary, other sources disclose its core meaning. The commentary
accompanying a provision of the Fourth Geneva Convention, for example,
defines “ ‘regularly constituted’ ” tribunals to include
“ordinary military courts” and “definitely exclud[e] all special
tribunals.” GCIV Commentary 340 (defining the term “properly
constituted” in Article 66, which the commentary treats as identical
to “regularly constituted”);[[64]] see also \\Yamashita,\\ 327 U.
S., at 44 (Rutledge, J., dissenting) (describing military commission
as a court “specially constituted for the particular trial”). And
one of the Red Cross’ own treatises defines “regularly constituted
court” as used in Common Article 3 to mean “established and
organised in accordance with the laws and procedures already in force
in a country.” Int’l Comm. of Red Cross, 1 Customary Int’l
Humanitarian Law 355 (2005); see also GCIV Commentary 340 (observing
that “ordinary military courts” will “be set up in accordance with
the recognized principles governing the administration of justice”).

^63 See also \\id.,\\ at 35 (Common Article 3 “has the merit of being
simple and clear. . . . Its observance does not depend upon preliminary
discussions on the nature of the conflict”); GCIV Commentary 51
(“[N]obody in enemy hands can be outside the law”); U. S. Army
Judge Advocate General’s Legal Center and School, Dept. of the Army,
Law of War Workshop Deskbook 228 (June 2000) (reprint 2004) (Common
Article 3 “serves as a ‘minimum yardstick of protection’ in all
conflicts, not just internal armed conflicts” (quoting \\Nicaragua\\
v. \\United States,\\ 1986 I. C. J. 14, ¶ 218, 25 I. L. M. 1023));

Defence Motion for Interlocutory Appeal on Jurisdiction, ¶ 102 (ICTY

conflict is irrelevant” in deciding whether Common Article 3 applies).

  The Government offers only a cursory defense of Hamdan’s military
commission in light of Common Article 3. See Brief for Respondents
49–50. As <<Justice Kennedy>> explains, that defense fails because
“[t]he regular military courts in our system are the courts-martial
established by congressional statutes.” \\Post,\\ at 644 (opinion
concurring in part). At a minimum, a military commission “can be
‘regularly constituted’ by the standards of our military justice
sys@@633@@tem only if some practical need explains deviations from
court-martial practice.” \\Post,\\ at 645. As we have explained, see
Part VI–C, \\supra,\\ no such need has been demonstrated here.[[65]]

^64 The commentary’s assumption that the terms “properly
constituted” and “regularly constituted” are interchangeable is
beyond reproach; the French version of Article 66, which is equally
authoritative, uses the term “re´gulie`rement constitue´s” in
place of “properly constituted.” 6 U. S. T., at 3559.

  Inextricably intertwined with the question of regular constitution
is the evaluation of the procedures governing the tribunal and whether
they afford “all the judicial guarantees which are recognized as
indispensable by civilized peoples.” 6 U. S. T., at 3320 (Art. 3,
¶ 1\\(d)\\). Like the phrase “regularly constituted court,” this
phrase is not defined in the text of the Geneva Conventions. But it
must be understood to incorporate at least the barest of those trial
protections that have been recognized by customary international law.
Many of these are described in Article 75 of Protocol I to the Geneva
Conventions of 1949, adopted in 1977 (Protocol I). Although the United
States declined to ratify Protocol I, its objections were not to Article
75 thereof. Indeed, it appears that the Government “regard[s] the
provisions of Article 75 as an articulation of safeguards to which all
persons in the hands of an enemy are entitled.” Taft, The Law of Armed
Conflict After 9/11: Some Salient Features, 28 Yale J. Int’l L. 319,
322 (2003). Among the rights set forth in Article 75 is the “right
to be tried in [one’s] presence.” Protocol I, Art. 75(4)(e).[[66]]

^65 Further evidence of this tribunal’s irregular constitution is the
fact that its rules and procedures are subject to change midtrial, at
the whim of the Executive. See Commission Order No. 1, § 11 (providing
that the Secretary of Defense may change the governing rules “from
time to time”).

^66 Other international instruments to which the United States is a
signatory include the same basic protections set forth in Article 75.
See, \\e. g.,\\ International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,
Art. 14, ¶ 3(\\d\\), Mar. 23, 1976, 999 U. N. T. S. 171 (setting forth
the right of an accused “[t]o be tried in his presence, and to defend
himself in person or through legal assistance of his own choosing”).
Following World War II, several defendants were tried and convicted
by military commission for violations @@634@@ of the law of war in
their failure to afford captives fair trials before imposition and
execution of sentence. In two such trials, the prosecutors argued that
the defendants’ failure to apprise accused individuals of all evidence
against them constituted violations of the law of war. See 5 U. N. War
Crimes Commission, Law Reports of Trials of War Criminals 25, 30 (1948)
(reprint 1997) (trial of Sergeant-Major Shigeru Ohashi), 66, 75 (trial
of General Tanaka Hisakasu).

  We agree with <<Justice Kennedy>> that the procedures adopted to
try Hamdan deviate from those governing courts-martial in ways not
justified by any “evident practical need,” \\post,\\ at 647, and
for that reason, at least, fail to afford the requisite guarantees.
See \\post,\\ at 646–653. We add only that, as noted in Part VI–A,
\\supra,\\ various provisions of Commission Order No. 1 dispense with
the principles, articulated in Article 75 and indisputably part of the
customary international law, that an accused must, absent disruptive
conduct or consent, be present for his trial and must be privy to the
evidence against him. See §§ 6(B)(3), (D).[[67]] That the @@635@@
Government has a compelling interest in denying Hamdan access to certain
sensitive information is not doubted. Cf. \\post,\\ at 723–724
(<<Thomas,>> J., dissenting). But, at least absent express statutory
provision to the contrary, information used to convict a person of a
crime must be disclosed to him.

^67 The Government offers no defense of these procedures other than to
observe that the defendant may not be barred from access to evidence
if such action would deprive him of a “full and fair trial.”
Commission Order No. 1, § 6(D)(5)(b). But the Government suggests no
circumstances in which it would be “fair” to convict the accused
based on evidence he has not seen or heard. Cf. \\Crawford\\ v.
\\Washington,\\ 541 U. S. 36, 49 (2004) (“ ‘It is a rule of the
common law, founded on natural justice, that no man shall be prejudiced
by evidence which he had not the liberty to cross examine’ ”
(quoting \\State\\ v. \\Webb,\\ 2 N. C. 103, 104 (Super. L. & Eq. 1794)
\\(per curiam)\\); \\Diaz\\ v. \\United States,\\ 223 U. S. 442, 455
(1912) (describing the right to be present as “scarcely less important
to the accused than the right of trial itself”); \\Lewis\\ v. \\United
States,\\ 146 U. S. 370, 372 (1892) (exclusion of defendant from part
of proceedings is “contrary to the dictates of humanity” (internal
quotation marks omitted)); \\Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Comm.\\ v.
\\McGrath,\\ 341 U. S. 123, 170, n. 17, 171 (1951) (Frankfurter, J.,
concurring) (“The plea that evidence of guilt must be secret is
abhorrent to free men” (internal quotation marks omitted)). More
fundamentally, the legality of a tribunal under Common Article 3 cannot
be established by bare assurances that, whatever the character of the
court or the procedures it follows, individual adjudicators will act
fairly.

        v

  Common Article 3 obviously tolerates a great degree of flexibility in
trying individuals captured during armed conflict; its requirements are
general ones, crafted to accommodate a wide variety of legal systems.
But \\requirements\\ they are nonetheless. The commission that the
President has convened to try Hamdan does not meet those requirements.

# VII

  We have assumed, as we must, that the allegations made in the
Government’s charge against Hamdan are true. We have assumed,
moreover, the truth of the message implicit in that charge—viz.,
that Hamdan is a dangerous individual whose beliefs, if acted upon,
would cause great harm and even death to innocent civilians, and
who would act upon those beliefs if given the opportunity. It bears
emphasizing that Hamdan does not challenge, and we do not today address,
the Government’s power to detain him for the duration of active
hostilities in order to prevent such harm. But in undertaking to try
Hamdan and subject him to criminal punishment, the Executive is bound to
comply with the rule of law that prevails in this jurisdiction.

  The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is
remanded for further proceedings.

          \\It is so ordered.\\
