Pursuant to Congress’ Joint Resolution authorizing the President
to “use all necessary and appropriate force against those nations,
organizations, or persons he determines planned, authorized, committed,
or aided” the September 11, 2001, al Qaeda terrorist attacks (AUMF),
U. S. Armed Forces invaded Afghanistan. During the hostilities, in
2001, militia forces captured petitioner Hamdan, a Yemeni national, and
turned him over to the U. S. military, which, in 2002, transported
him to prison in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Over a year later, the
President deemed Hamdan eligible for trial by military commission
for then-unspecified crimes. After another year, he was charged
with conspiracy “to commit . . . offenses triable by military
commission.” In habeas and mandamus petitions, Hamdan asserted
that the military commission lacks authority to try him because (1)
neither congressional Act nor the common law of war supports trial by
this commission for conspiracy, an offense that, Hamdan says, is not
a violation of the law of war; and (2) the procedures adopted to try
him violate basic tenets of military and international law, including
the principle that a defendant must be permitted to see and hear the
evidence against him.

The District Court granted habeas relief and stayed the commission’s
proceedings, concluding that the President’s authority to establish
military commissions extends only to offenders or offenses triable by
such a commission under the law of war; that such law includes the
Third Geneva Convention; that Hamdan is entitled to that Convention’s
full protections until adjudged, under it, not to be a prisoner of war;
and that, whether or not Hamdan is properly classified a prisoner of
war, the commission convened to try him was established in violation
of both the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), 10 U. S. C.
§801 \\et seq.,\\ and Common Article 3 of the Third Geneva Convention
because it had the power to convict based on evidence the accused would
never see or hear. The D. C. Circuit reversed. Although it declined
the Government’s invitation to abstain from considering Hamdan’s
challenge, cf. \\Schlesinger\\ v. \\Councilman,\\ 420 U. S. 738, the
appeals court ruled, on the merits, that Hamdan was not entitled to
relief because the Geneva Conventions are not judicially enforceable.
The court also concluded @@558@@ that \\Ex parte Quirin,\\ 317 U. S.
1, foreclosed any separation-of-powers objection to the military
commission’s jurisdiction, and that Hamdan’s trial before the
commission would violate neither the UCMJ nor Armed Forces regulations
implementing the Geneva Conventions. \\Held:\\ The judgment is reversed,
and the case is remanded.

415 F. 3d 33, reversed and remanded.

<<Justice Stevens>> delivered the opinion of the Court, except as to
Parts V and VI–D–iv, concluding:

1. The Government’s motion to dismiss, based on the Detainee
Treatment Act of 2005 (DTA), is denied. DTA § 1005(e)(1) provides
that “no court. . .shall have jurisdiction to hear or consider. . .an
application for . . . habeas corpus filed by . . .an alien detained. . . at
Guantanamo Bay.” Section 1005(h)(2) provides that §§ 1005(e)(2)
and (3)—which give the D. C. Circuit “exclusive” jurisdiction to
review the final decisions of, respectively, combatant status review
tribunals and military commissions—“shall apply with respect to any
claim whose review is . . . pending on” the DTA’s effective date, as
was Hamdan’s case. The Government’s argument that §§ 1005(e)(1)
and (h) repeal this Court’s jurisdiction to review the decision
below is rebutted by ordinary principles of statutory construction. A
negative inference may be drawn from Congress’ failure to include
§ 1005(e)(1) within the scope of § 1005(h)(2). Cf., \\e. g.,
Lindh\\ v. \\Murphy,\\ 521 U. S. 320, 330. “If . . . Congress was
reasonably concerned to ensure that [§§ 1005(e)(2) and (3)] be
applied to pending cases, it should have been just as concerned about
[§ 1005(e)(1)], unless it had the different intent that the latter
[section] not be applied to the general run of pending cases.”
\\Id.,\\ at 329. If anything, the evidence of deliberate omission is
stronger here than it was in \\Lindh.\\ The legislative history shows
that Congress not only considered the respective temporal reaches of
§§ 1005(e)(1), (2), and (3) together at every stage, but omitted
paragraph (1) from its directive only after having \\rejected\\ earlier
proposed versions of the statute that would have included what is now
paragraph (1) within that directive’s scope. Congress’ rejection of
the very language that would have achieved the result the Government
urges weighs heavily against the Government’s interpretation. See
\\Doe\\ v. \\Chao,\\ 540 U. S. 614, 621–623. Pp. 572–584.

2. The Government argues unpersuasively that abstention is appropriate
under \\Councilman,\\ which concluded that, as a matter of comity,
federal courts should normally abstain from intervening in pending
courts-martial against service members, see 420 U. S., at 740. Neither
of the comity considerations \\Councilman\\ identified weighs in favor
of abstention here. First, the assertion that military discipline and,
there@@559@@fore, the Armed Forces’ efficient operation, are best
served if the military justice system acts without regular interference
from civilian courts, see \\id.,\\ at 752, is inapt because Hamdan
is not a service member. Second, the view that federal courts should
respect the balance Congress struck when it created “an integrated
system of military courts and review procedures” is inapposite, since
the tribunal convened to try Hamdan is not part of that integrated
system. Rather than \\Councilman,\\ the most relevant precedent is
\\Ex parte Quirin,\\ where the Court, far from abstaining pending the
conclusion of ongoing military proceedings, expedited its review because
of (1) the public importance of the questions raised, (2) the Court’s
duty, in both peace and war, to preserve the constitutional safeguards
of civil liberty, and (3) the public interest in a decision on those
questions without delay, 317 U. S., at 19. The Government has identified
no countervailing interest that would permit federal courts to depart
from their general duty to exercise the jurisdiction Congress has
conferred on them. Pp. 584–590.

3. The military commission at issue is not expressly authorized by
any congressional Act. \\Quirin\\ held that Congress had, through
Article of War 15, sanctioned the use of military commissions to try
offenders or offenses against the law of war. 317 U. S., at 28. UCMJ
Art. 21, which is substantially identical to the old Art. 15, reads:
“The jurisdiction [of] courts-martial shall not be construed as
depriving military commissions. . .of concurrent jurisdiction in respect
of offenders or offenses that by statute or by the law of war may be
tried by such . . . commissions.” 10 U. S. C. § 821. Contrary
to the Government’s assertion, even \\Quirin\\ did not view that
authorization as a sweeping mandate for the President to invoke military
commissions whenever he deems them necessary. Rather, \\Quirin\\
recognized that Congress had simply preserved what power, under the
Constitution and the common law of war, the President already had to
convene military commissions—with the express condition that he
and those under his command comply with the law of war. See 317 U.
S., at 28–29. Neither the AUMF nor the DTA can be read to provide
specific, overriding authorization for the commission convened to try
Hamdan. Assuming the AUMF activated the President’s war powers,
see \\Hamdi\\ v. \\Rumsfeld,\\ 542 U. S. 507, and that those powers
include authority to convene military commissions in appropriate
circumstances, see, \\e. g., id.,\\ at 518, there is nothing in the
AUMF’s text or legislative history even hinting that Congress intended
to expand or alter the authorization set forth in UCMJ Art. 21. Cf. \\Ex
parte Yerger,\\ 8 Wall. 85, 105. Likewise, the DTA cannot be read to
authorize this commission. Although the DTA, unlike either Art. 21 or
the AUMF, was enacted after the President convened Hamdan’s @@560@@
commission, it contains no language authorizing that tribunal or any
other at Guantanamo Bay. Together, the UCMJ, the AUMF, and the DTA at
most acknowledge a general Presidential authority to convene military
commissions in circumstances where justified under the Constitution and
laws, including the law of war. Absent a more specific congressional
authorization, this Court’s task is, as it was in \\Quirin,\\ to
decide whether Hamdan’s military commission is so justified. Pp.
590–595.

4. The military commission at issue lacks the power to proceed because
its structure and procedures violate both the UCMJ and the four Geneva
Conventions signed in 1949. Pp. 613–635.

(a) The commission’s procedures, set forth in Commission Order No.
1, provide, among other things, that an accused and his civilian
counsel may be excluded from, and precluded from ever learning what
evidence was presented during, any part of the proceeding the official
who appointed the commission or the presiding officer decides to
“close.” Grounds for closure include the protection of classified
information, the physical safety of participants and witnesses, the
protection of intelligence and law enforcement sources, methods, or
activities, and “other national security interests.” Appointed
military defense counsel must be privy to these closed sessions, but
may, at the presiding officer’s discretion, be forbidden to reveal
to the client what took place therein. Another striking feature is
that the rules governing Hamdan’s commission permit the admission
of \\any\\ evidence that, in the presiding officer’s opinion, would
have probative value to a reasonable person. Moreover, the accused
and his civilian counsel may be denied access to classified and other
“protected information,” so long as the presiding officer concludes
that the evidence is “probative” and that its admission without the
accused’s knowledge would not result in the denial of a full and fair
trial. Pp. 613–615.

(b) The Government objects to this Court’s consideration of a
procedural challenge at this stage on the grounds, \\inter alia,\\ that
Hamdan will be able to raise such a challenge following a final decision
under the DTA, and that there is no basis to presume, before the trial
has even commenced, that it will not be conducted in good faith and
according to law. These contentions are unsound. First, because Hamdan
apparently is not subject to the death penalty (at least as matters
now stand) and may receive a prison sentence shorter than 10 years, he
has no automatic right to federal-court review of the commission’s
“final decision” under DTA § 1005(e)(3). Second, there \\is\\ a
basis to presume that the procedures employed during Hamdan’s trial
will violate the law: He will be, and \\indeed already has been,\\
excluded from his own trial. @@561@@ Thus, review of the procedures in
advance of a “final decision” is appropriate. Pp. 615–616.

(c) Because UCMJ Article 36 has not been complied with here, the
rules specified for Hamdan’s commission trial are illegal. The
procedures governing such trials historically have been the same as
those governing courts-martial. Although this uniformity principle is
not inflexible and does not preclude all departures from court-martial
procedures, any such departure must be tailored to the exigency that
necessitates it. That understanding is reflected in Art. 36(b), which
provides that the procedural rules the President promulgates for
courts-martial and military commissions alike must be “uniform insofar
as practicable,” 10 U. S. C. § 836(b). The “practicability”
determination the President has made is insufficient to justify
variances from the procedures governing courts-martial. The President
here has determined, pursuant to the requirement of \\Art. 36(a),\\
that it is impracticable to apply the rules and principles of law
that govern “the trial of criminal cases in the United States
district courts” to Hamdan’s commission. The President has
not, however, made a similar official determination that it is
impracticable to apply the rules for courts-martial. And even if
subsection (b)’s requirements could be satisfied without an official
practicability determination, that subsection’s requirements are not
satisfied here. Nothing in the record demonstrates that it would be
impracticable to apply court-martial rules here. There is no suggestion,
\\e. g.,\\ of any logistical difficulty in securing properly sworn
and authenticated evidence or in applying the usual principles of
relevance and admissibility. It is not evident why the danger posed by
international terrorism, considerable though it is, should require,
in the case of Hamdan’s trial, any variance from the court-martial
rules. The absence of any showing of impracticability is particularly
disturbing when considered in light of the clear and admitted failure
to apply one of the most fundamental protections afforded not just by
the Manual for Courts-Martial but also by the UCMJ itself: The right to
be present. See 10 U. S. C. § 839(c). Because the jettisoning of
so basic a right cannot lightly be excused as “practicable,” the
court-martial rules must apply. Since it is undisputed that Commission
Order No. 1 deviates in many significant respects from those rules, it
necessarily violates Art. 36(b). Pp. 617–625.

(d) The procedures adopted to try Hamdan also violate the Geneva
Conventions. The D. C. Circuit dismissed Hamdan’s challenge in this
regard on the grounds, \\inter alia,\\ that the Conventions are not
judicially enforceable and that, in any event, Hamdan is not entitled
to their protections. Neither of these grounds is persuasive. Pp.
625–631. @@562@@

(i) The appeals court relied on a statement in \\Johnson\\ v.
\\Eisentrager,\\ 339 U. S. 763, 789, n. 14, suggesting that this Court
lacked power even to consider the merits of a Convention argument
because the political and military authorities had sole responsibility
for observing and enforcing prisoners’ rights under the Convention.
However, \\Eisentrager\\ does not control here because, regardless of
the nature of the rights conferred on Hamdan, cf. \\United States\\ v.
\\Rauscher,\\ 119 U. S. 407, they are indisputably part of the law
of war, see \\Hamdi,\\ 542 U. S., at 520–521, compliance with which
is the condition upon which UCMJ Art. 21 authority is granted. Pp.
626–628.

(ii) Alternatively, the appeals court agreed with the Government that
the Conventions do not apply because Hamdan was captured during the war
with al Qaeda, which is not a Convention signatory, and that conflict
is distinct from the war with signatory Afghanistan. The Court need
not decide the merits of this argument because there is at least one
provision of the Geneva Conventions that applies here even if the
relevant conflict is not between signatories. Common Article 3, which
appears in all four Conventions, provides that, in a “conflict not of
an international character occurring in the territory of one of the High
Contracting Parties [\\i. e.,\\ signatories], each Party to the conflict
shall be bound to apply, as a minimum,” certain provisions protecting
“[p]ersons . . . placed \\hors de combat\\ by . . . detention,”
including a prohibition on “the passing of sentences . . .without
previous judgment. . . byaregularly constituted court affording all the
judicial guarantees . . . recognized as indispensable by civilized
peoples.” The D. C. Circuit ruled Common Article 3 inapplicable to
Hamdan because the conflict with al Qaeda is international in scope
and thus not a “conflict not of an international character.” That
reasoning is erroneous. That the quoted phrase bears its literal meaning
and is used here in contradistinction to a conflict between nations is
demonstrated by Common Article 2, which limits its own application to
any armed conflict between signatories and provides that signatories
must abide by all terms of the Conventions even if another party to
the conflict is a nonsignatory, so long as the nonsignatory “accepts
and applies” those terms. Common Article 3, by contrast, affords
some minimal protection, falling short of full protection under the
Conventions, to individuals associated with neither a signatory nor
even a nonsignatory who are involved in a conflict “in the territory
of” a signatory. The latter kind of conflict does not involve a clash
between nations (whether signatories or not). Pp. 628–631.

(iii) While Common Article 3 does not define its “regularly
constituted court” phrase, other sources define the words to mean an
“ordinary military cour[t]” that is “established and organized
in accordance @@563@@ with the laws and procedures already in force
in a country.” The regular military courts in our system are the
courts-martial established by congressional statute. At a minimum, a
military commission can be “regularly constituted” only if some
practical need explains deviations from court-martial practice. No such
need has been demonstrated here. Pp. 631–633.

(iv) Common Article 3’s requirements are general, crafted
to accommodate a wide variety of legal systems, but they are
\\requirements\\ nonetheless. The commission convened to try Hamdan does
not meet those requirements. P. 635.

(e) Even assuming that Hamden is a dangerous individual who would cause
great harm or death to innocent civilians given the opportunity, the
Executive nevertheless must comply with the prevailing rule of law in
undertaking to try him and subject him to criminal punishment. P. 635.

<<Justice Stevens,>> joined by <<Justice Souter, Justice Ginsburg,>> and
<<Justice Breyer,>> concluded in Parts V and VI–D–iv:

1. The Government has not charged Hamdan with an “offens[e]. . .
that. . . by the law of war may be tried by military commissio[n],” 10
U. S. C. § 821. Of the three sorts of military commissions used
historically, the law-of-war type used in \\Quirin\\ and other cases
is the only model available to try Hamdan. Among the preconditions,
incorporated in Article of War 15 and, later, UCMJ Art. 21, for such
a tribunal’s exercise of jurisdiction are, \\inter alia,\\ that it
must be limited to trying offenses committed within the convening
commander’s field of command, \\i. e.,\\ within the theater of
war, and that the offense charged must have been committed during,
not before or after, the war. Here, Hamdan is not alleged to have
committed any overt act in a theater of war or on any specified date
after September 11, 2001. More importantly, the offense alleged is
not triable by law-of-war military commission. Although the common
law of war may render triable by military commission certain offenses
not defined by statute, \\Quirin,\\ 317 U. S., at 30, the precedent
for doing so with respect to a particular offense must be plain
and unambiguous, cf., \\e. g., Loving\\ v. \\United States,\\ 517
U. S. 748, 771. That burden is far from satisfied here. The crime of
“conspiracy” has rarely if ever been tried as such in this country
by any law-of-war military commission not exercising some other form of
jurisdiction, and does not appear in either the Geneva Conventions or
the Hague Conventions—the major treaties on the law of war. Moreover,
that conspiracy is not a recognized violation of the law of war is
confirmed by other international sources, including, \\e. g.,\\ the
International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg, which pointedly refused to
recognize conspiracy to commit war crimes as such a violation. Because
the conspiracy charge @@564@@ does not support the commission’s
jurisdiction, the commission lacks authority to try Hamdan. Pp.
595–613.

2. The phrase “all the judicial guarantees . . . recognized as
indispensable by civilized peoples” in Common Article 3 of the Geneva
Conventions is not defined, but it must be understood to incorporate
at least the barest of the trial protections recognized by customary
international law. The procedures adopted to try Hamdan deviate from
those governing courts-martial in ways not justified by practical need,
and thus fail to afford the requisite guarantees. Moreover, various
provisions of Commission Order No. 1 dispense with the principles, which
are indisputably part of customary international law, that an accused
must, absent disruptive conduct or consent, be present for his trial and
must be privy to the evidence against him. Pp. 633–635.

<<Justice Kennedy,>> agreeing that Hamdan’s military commission is
unauthorized under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, 10 U. S. C.
§§ 836 and 821, and the Geneva Conventions, concluded that there is
therefore no need to decide whether Common Article 3 of the Conventions
requires that the accused have the right to be present at all stages of
a criminal trial or to address the validity of the conspiracy charge
against Hamdan. Pp. 653–655. <<Stevens,>> J., announced the judgment
of the Court and delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to
Parts I through IV, VI through VI–D–iii, VI–D–v, and VII, in
