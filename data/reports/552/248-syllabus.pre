  Petitioner, a participant in a defined contribution pension plan,
alleged that the plan administrator’s failure to follow petitioner’s
investment directions “depleted” his interest in the plan by
approximately $150,000 and amounted to a breach of fiduciary duty
under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA).
The District Court granted respondents judgment on the pleadings, and
the Fourth Circuit affirmed. Relying on {{\\Massachusetts Mutual Life
Ins. Co.\\ v. \\Russell,\\ 473 U. S. 134}}, the Circuit held that
ERISA § 502(a)(2) provides remedies only for entire plans, not for
individuals.

\\Held:\\

  Although § 502(a)(2) does not provide a remedy for individual
injuries distinct from plan injuries, it does authorize recovery
for fiduciary breaches that impair the value of plan assets in a
participant’s individual account. Section 502(a)(2) provides
for suits to enforce the liabilitycreating provisions of § 409,
concerning breaches of fiduciary duties that harm plans. The principal
statutory duties imposed by § 409 relate to the proper management,
administration, and investment of plan assets, with an eye toward
ensuring that the benefits authorized by the plan are ultimately paid
to plan participants. The misconduct that petitioner alleges falls
squarely within that category, unlike the misconduct in \\Russell.\\
There, the plaintiff received all of the benefits to which she was
contractually entitled, but sought consequential damages arising from
a delay in the processing of her claim. \\Russell\\’s emphasis on
protecting the “entire plan” reflects the fact that the disability
plan in \\Russell,\\ as well as the typical pension plan at that time,
promised participants a fixed benefit. Misconduct by such a plan’s
administrators will not affect an individual’s entitlement to a
defined benefit unless it creates or enhances the risk of default by
the entire plan. For defined contribution plans, however, fiduciary
misconduct need not threaten the entire plan’s solvency to reduce
benefits below the amount that participants would otherwise receive.
Whether a fiduciary breach diminishes plan assets payable to all
participants or only to particular individuals, it creates the
kind of harms that concerned § 409’s draftsmen. Thus, @@249@@
\\Russell\\’s “entire plan” references, which accurately reflect
§ 409’s operation in the defined benefit context, are beside the
point in the defined contribution context. {{Pp. 252–256.}}
