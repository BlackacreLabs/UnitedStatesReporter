  \textsc{Justice Thomas,} dissenting.

  As I have stated on many previous occasions, I believe that the
Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), 9 U.~S.~C. \S~1 \emph{et seq.} (2000
ed. and Supp. V), does not apply to proceedings in state courts.
See \emph{Allied-Bruce Terminix Cos.} v. \emph{Dobson,} 513 U.~S. 265,
285--297 (1995) (dissenting opinion); see also \emph{Buckeye Check Cashing,
Inc.} v. \emph{Cardegna,} 546 U.~S. 440, 449 (2006) (same); \emph{Green Tree
Financial Corp.} v. \emph{Bazzle,} 539 U.~S. 444, 460 (2003) (same);
\emph{Doctor's Associates, Inc.} v. \emph{Casarotto,} 517 U.~S. 681,
689 (1996) (same). Thus, in statecourt proceedings, the FAA cannot
displace a state law that delays arbitration until administrative
proceedings are completed. Accordingly, I would affirm the judgment of
the Court of Appeal.
