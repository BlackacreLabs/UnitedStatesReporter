  The Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) waives the United States’
sovereign immunity for claims arising out of torts committed by federal
employees, {{see 28 U. S. C. § 1346(b)(1)}}, but, as relevant here,
exempts from that waiver “[a]ny claim arising in respect of the
assessment or collection of any tax or customs duty, or the detention of
any . . . property by any officer of customs or excise or any other
law enforcement officer,” {{§ 2680(c)}}. Upon his transfer from
an Atlanta federal prison to one in Kentucky, petitioner noticed that
several items were missing from his personal property, which had been
shipped to the new facility by the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP).
Alleging that BOP officers had lost his property, petitioner filed this
suit under, \\inter alia,\\ the FTCA, but the District Court dismissed
that claim as barred by § 2680(c). Affirming, the Eleventh Circuit
rejected petitioner’s argument that the statutory phrase “any
officer of customs or excise or any other law enforcement officer”
applies only to officers enforcing customs or excise laws.

\\Held:\\

  Section 2680(c)’s text and structure demonstrate that the broad
phrase “any other law enforcement officer” covers all law
enforcement officers. Petitioner’s argument that § 2680(c) is
focused on preserving sovereign immunity only for officers enforcing
customs and excise laws is inconsistent with the statute’s language.
“Read naturally, the word ‘any’ has an expansive meaning, that
is, ‘one or some indiscriminately of whatever kind.’” {{\\United
States\\ v. \\Gonzales,\\ 520 U. S. 1, 5.}} For example, in considering
a provision imposing an additional sentence that was not to run
concurrently with “any other term of imprisonment,” {{18 U. S. C.
§ 924(c)(1)}}, the \\Gonzales\\ Court held that, notwithstanding the
subsection’s initial reference to federal drug trafficking crimes,
the expansive word “any” and the absence of restrictive language
left “no basis in the text for limiting” the phrase “any other
term of imprisonment” to federal sentences. {{520 U. S., at 5}}. To
similar effect, {{see \\Harrison\\ v. \\PPG Industries, Inc.,\\ 446
U. S. 578, 588–589}}, in which the Court held that there was “no
indication whatever that Congress intended” to limit the “expansive
language” “ ‘any other final action’ ” to particular kinds of
agency action. The reasoning of \\Gonzales\\ and \\Harrison\\ applies
equally to {{28 U. S. C. § 2680(c)}}: Congress’ use of “any”
to modify “other law enforcement officer” is most naturally read
to mean @@215@@ ences to “tax or customs duty” and “officer[s]
of customs or excise” indicate an intent to preserve immunity for
claims arising from an officer’s enforcement of tax and customs laws.
The text also indicates, however, that Congress intended to preserve
immunity for claims arising from the detention of property, and there is
no indication of any intent that immunity for those claims turns on the
type of law being enforced. Recent amendments to § 2680(c) restoring
the sovereign immunity waiver for officers enforcing \\any\\ federal
forfeiture law, {{see § 2680(c)(1)}}, support the Court’s conclusion
by demonstrating Congress’ view that, prior to the amendments,
§ 2680(c) covered \\all\\ law enforcement officers. Against this
textual and structural evidence, petitioner’s reliance on the canons
of statutory construction \\ejusdem generis\\ and \\noscitur a sociis\\
and on the rule against superfluities is unconvincing. The Court is
unpersuaded by petitioner’s attempt to create ambiguity where the
statute’s structure and text suggest none. Had Congress intended to
limit § 2680(c)’s reach as petitioner contends, it easily could have
written “any other law enforcement officer \\acting in a customs or
excise capacity.\\” Instead, it used the unmodified, all-encompassing
phrase “any other law enforcement officer.” This Court must give
effect to the text Congress enacted.{{Pp. 217–228.}}
