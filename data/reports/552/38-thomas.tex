  \textsc{Justice Thomas,} dissenting.

  Consistent with my dissenting opinion in \emph{Kimbrough} v. \emph{United
States, post,} p. 114, I would affirm the judgment of the Court of
Appeals because the District Court committed statutory error when it
departed below the applicable Guidelines range.
