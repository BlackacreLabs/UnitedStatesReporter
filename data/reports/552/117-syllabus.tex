  Respondent was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to death in state court. Finding that he had received ineffective assistance of counsel during his trial's sentencing phase but not during plea bargaining, the Federal District Court subsequently granted habeas relief, or dering that he be resentenced. The Ninth Circuit affirmed the judgment with respect to sentencing and reversed with respect to plea bargaining.

\emph{Held:}

  Respondent's motion to vacate and dismiss as moot the Ninth Circuit's judgment, to the extent it addressed his plea bargaining claim, is granted. He wishes to abandon that claim so that he may proceed with the resentencing ordered by the District Court. The Ninth Circuit is directed to instruct the District Court to dismiss the relevant claim with prejudice.

\noindent Motion granted; 455 F. 3d 926, vacated in part and remanded.
