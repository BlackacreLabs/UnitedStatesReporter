  <<Justice Scalia,>> concurring in part.

  I join the opinion of the Court, except those portions ({{\\ante,\\
at 370, 373, and 374}}) that rely on the reports of committees of one
House of Congress to show the intent of that full House and of the
otherâ€”with regard to propositions that are apparent from the text of
the law, unnecessary to the disposition of the case, or both.
