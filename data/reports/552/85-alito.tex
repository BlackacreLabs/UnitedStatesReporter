  \textsc{Justice Alito,} dissenting.

  For the reasons explained in my dissent in \emph{Gall} v. \emph{United}
\emph{States, ante,} p. 61, I would hold that, under the remedial
decision in \emph{United States} v. \emph{Booker,} 543 U.~S. 220, 258--265
(2005), a district judge is still required to give significant weight
to the policy decisions embodied in the Federal Sentencing Guidelines.
The \emph{Booker} remedial decision, however, does not permit a court of
appeals to treat the Guidelines' policy decisions as binding. I would
not draw a distinction between the Guideline at issue here and other
Guidelines. Accordingly, I would vacate the decision of the Court of
Appeals and remand for reconsideration.
