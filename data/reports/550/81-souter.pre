  <<Justice Souter,>> dissenting.

  I agree with the Court that Congress probably intended, or at least
understood, that the Secretary would continue to follow the methodology
devised prior to passage of the current statute in 1994, see \\ante,\\
at 90–91. But for reasons set out in <<Justice Scalia>>’s dissent,
I find the statutory language unambiguous and inapt to authorize that
methodology, and I therefore join Part I of his dissenting opinion.
