The District Court dismissed respondent’s first federal habeas petition 
without prejudice on the ground that his state postconviction proceedings were not exhausted while he had a certiorari petition pending. 
After this Court denied certiorari, respondent refiled his habeas petition, raising a claim essentially identical to that made in two other cases 
in which the Eighth Circuit had granted habeas relief. Those cases, 
like respondent’s first habeas petition, had been filed before the effective 
date of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 
(AEDPA). The District Court granted relief. The Eighth Circuit affirmed, but concluded that, because respondent’s petition was refiled 
after AEDPA’s effective date, his claims must be evaluated under that 
statute’s strict standard of review. 
\\Held:\\ The petition for writ of certiorari is dismissed as improvidently 
granted. The District Court erred in dismissing respondent’s first habeas petition, which was fully exhausted and did not become unexhausted upon his decision to seek certiorari, see \\Lawrence\\ v. \\Florida,\\ 
549 U. S. 327. Regardless of whether, as respondent contends, AEDPA 
is inapplicable to his case, it is appropriate for this Court to exercise its 
discretion to prevent three virtually identically situated litigants from 
being treated in a needlessly disparate manner, simply because the District Court erroneously dismissed respondent’s pre-AEDPA petition.

  We granted certiorari in this case, 549 U. S. 1092 (2006), to 
decide whether the Court of Appeals had exceeded its authority under 28 U. S. C. § 2254(d)(1) by setting aside a capital sentence on the ground that the prosecutor’s closing 
statement was “unfairly inflammatory.” \\Weaver\\ v. \\Bower­\\
\\sox,\\ 438 F. 3d 832, 841 (CA8 2006). Our primary concern 
was whether the Court of Appeals’ application of the more 
stringent standard of review mandated by the Antiterrorism 
and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 110 Stat. 
1214, was consistent with our interpretation of that statute. 
Cf. \\Carey\\ v. \\Musladin,\\ 549 U. S. 70 (2006). We are now 
aware of circumstances that persuade us that dismissal of 
the writ is the appropriate manner in which to dispose of 
this case. 

  The argument made by the prosecutor in this case was 
essentially the same as the argument that he made in two 
other cases—one of which involved respondent’s codefendant. See \\Shurn\\ v. \\Delo,\\ 177 F. 3d 662, 666 (CA8 1999); \\New­\\
\\lon\\ v. \\Armontrout,\\ 693 F. Supp. 799 (WD Mo. 1988), aff’d, 885 
F. 2d 1328 (CA8 1989). In each of those cases, the defendant 
received a death sentence. Also in each case, the defendant 
filed a petition seeking federal habeas relief before AEDPA’s 
effective date. Federal habeas relief was granted in all 
three cases. The State does not question the propriety of

relief in the other two cases because it was clear at the time, 
as it is now, that AEDPA did not apply to either of them. 

  Respondent argues, for the following reasons, that 
AEDPA should not govern his case either. Like the defendants in \\Newlon\\ and \\Shurn,\\ respondent filed his federal habeas petition before the effective date of AEDPA. Instead 
of considering respondent’s claims, however, the District 
Court \\sua sponte\\ stayed the habeas proceedings, noting that 
respondent had indicated his intention to file a petition for 
writ of certiorari seeking this Court’s review of the state 
courts’ denial of postconviction relief. Though the District 
Court recognized that respondent was not required to seek 
certiorari from this Court, it concluded that, if “a state prisoner chooses to pursue writ of certiorari, he must first exhaust that remedy before filing a federal habeas corpus petition.” App. to Brief for National Association of Criminal 
Defense Lawyers as \\Amicus Curiae\\ 15. Thus, the District 
Court put respondent to a choice: He could forgo filing a petition for certiorari, or his habeas petition would be dismissed. 

  Respondent moved for reconsideration and for the appointment of counsel. The District Court denied both motions, reiterating its view that if respondent sought certiorari, his federal habeas petition would be premature. When 
respondent notified the District Court that a petition for certiorari had been filed, the court made good on its promise: It 
dismissed respondent’s habeas petition “without prejudice” 
to his refiling “following exhaustion of his state proceedings.” \\Id.,\\ at 13. Though respondent had filed his habeas 
petition before AEDPA took effect, the District Court dismissed his petition after the statute was in force. 

  Still without an attorney, respondent requested a certificate of appealability from the District Court. The court denied the request, opining that reasonable jurists could not 
disagree with the dismissal of respondent’s petition. \\Id.,\\ at 
5–6. Respondent also filed a notice of appeal, which the 

@@601@@

Court of Appeals construed as a request for a certificate of 
appealability and rejected.[[*]]

  Respondent refiled his habeas petition after this Court denied review of his state postconviction proceedings. The 
Eighth Circuit eventually concluded that, because respondent’s petition was filed after AEDPA’s effective date, his 
claims must be evaluated under that statute’s strict standard 
of review. See \\Weaver\\ v. \\Bowersox,\\ 241 F. 3d 1024, 1029 
(2001). 

  Our recent decision in \\Lawrence\\ v. \\Florida,\\ 549 U. S. 327 
(2007), conclusively establishes that the District Court was 
wrong to conclude that, if respondent chose to seek certiorari, he had to exhaust that remedy before filing a federal 
habeas petition. \\Lawrence\\ clarified that “[s]tate review 
ends when the state courts have finally resolved an application for state postconviction relief”—even if a prisoner files 
a certiorari petition. \\Id.,\\ at 332; see also \\id.,\\ at 332–333 
(“[W]e have said that state prisoners need not petition for 
certiorari to exhaust state remedies” (citing \\Fay\\ v. \\Noia,\\ 372 
U. S. 391, 435–438 (1963))). Thus, respondent’s habeas petition, which was fully exhausted when filed, did not become 
unexhausted upon his decision to seek certiorari. Because 
the petition was not premature, the District Court had no 
cause to dismiss it. 

  Whether this unusual procedural history leads to the conclusion, as respondent colorably contends, that the AEDPA 
standard is simply inapplicable to this case, is a question we 
find unnecessary to resolve. Regardless of the answer to 
that question, we find it appropriate to exercise our discretion to prevent these three virtually identically situated litigants from being treated in a needlessly disparate manner, 

^* Respondent did not seek rehearing or rehearing en banc in the Court 
of Appeals, nor did he file a petition for writ of certiorari from the denial 
of the certificate of appealability. Pursuit of either would almost certainly 
have been futile.

simply because the District Court erroneously dismissed respondent’s pre-AEDPA petition. 

  Accordingly, the writ of certiorari is dismissed as improvidently granted. 

        \\It is so ordered.\\ 

  <<Chief Justice Roberts,>> concurring in the result. 

  While I do not agree with all the reasons given in the \\per\\

disposition. 

  <<Justice Scalia,>> with whom <<Justice Thomas>> and <<Jus­>>
<<tice Alito>> join, dissenting. 

  The Eighth Circuit held in this case that the Missouri Supreme Court had unreasonably applied clearly established 
precedent of this Court in concluding that certain statements 
made by the prosecutor during the penalty phase of respondent’s capital trial did not rise to the level of a due process 
violation. \\Weaver\\ v. \\Bowersox,\\ 438 F. 3d 832, 839–842 
(2006). As the Court says, \\ante,\\ at 599, we granted certiorari to decide whether this holding comported with the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 
28 U. S. C. § 2254(d)(1). We received briefing, and heard an 
hour’s argument, on that question. Yet now the Court declines to answer it, dismissing the writ as improvidently 
granted. 

  The reason is that the Court has become “aware,” \\ante,\\ at 
599, that respondent’s post-AEDPA habeas petition was filed 
only because the District Court had erroneously dismissed 
an earlier petition filed prior to AEDPA’s effective date, 
\\ante,\\ at 600, 601. Believing that respondent is “virtually 
identically situated” to two other litigants whose federal habeas petitions were not governed by AEDPA, and seeking 
to avoid “treat[ing the three] in a needlessly disparate manner . . . simply because the District Court erroneously dis@@603@@missed respondent’s pre-AEDPA petition,” the Court has decided to let stand the Eighth Circuit’s flagrant misapplication 
of AEDPA, whether or not (and without deciding whether) 
AEDPA governs this case. \\Ante,\\ at 601–602. 

  I fully agree with the Court that the District Court erred 
in dismissing respondent’s pre-AEDPA petition, but that 
seems to me no justification for aborting this argued case. 
The District Court’s previous error does not affect the \\legal\\ 
conclusion that AEDPA applies to this new petition. And 
once it is admitted that AEDPA governs, the District Court’s 
error should in no way alter our prior determination that the 
Eighth Circuit’s application of AEDPA deserves our scrutiny. I discuss these two points in succession. 

# I
  The Court provides no legal argument to support its assertion that respondent has a “colorabl[e]” claim, \\ante,\\ at 601, 
that the prior erroneous dismissal renders AEDPA inapplicable to this case. Nor does respondent. See Brief for 
Respondent 39, n. 44. I am aware of no authority supporting the proposition that respondent is legally or equitably 
entitled to evade the collateral consequences of the District 
Court’s error. 

  To begin with, any resort to equity would founder on respondent’s failure to exhaust his appeals of the District 
Court’s erroneous decision. See \\ante,\\ at 601, n. The Court 
is untroubled by respondent’s lack of diligence because, it 
says, further appellate review “would almost certainly have 
been futile.” \\Ibid.\\ The Court does not explain the basis 
for this pessimistic assessment, but the reason seems to be 
its belief that the District Court’s error was not clear until 
our recent decision in \\Lawrence\\ v. \\Florida,\\ 549 U. S. 327 
(2007). See \\ante,\\ at 601 (describing \\Lawrence\\ as “clarif[ying]” the exhaustion rule). 

  This seems to me quite wrong. The District Court’s error 
was as apparent in 1996 as it was in \\1966.\\ In \\Fay\\ v. \\Noia,\\ 

@@604@@

372 U. S. 391, 435–438 (1963), we announced in no uncertain 
terms that a federal habeas petitioner need not seek certiorari in order to exhaust state-court remedies. “[N]o less an 
authority than Hart & Wechsler’s The Federal Courts and 
the Federal System,” \\Massachusetts\\ v. \\EPA,\\ 549 U. S. 497, 
520, n. 17 (2007), has long understood \\Noia\\ to stand for that 
proposition. See P. Bator, D. Meltzer, P. Mishkin, & D. Shapiro, Hart & Wechsler’s The Federal Courts and the Federal 
System 1555 (3d ed. 1988); \\id.,\\ at 1446 (4th ed. 1996); \\id.,\\ 
at 1391 (5th ed. 2003). Indeed, \\Lawrence\\’s “clarifi[cation]” 
consisted of nothing more than citing the same old pages in 
\\Noia.\\ See \\Lawrence, supra,\\ at 333. It logically follows 
from \\Noia\\ no less inescapably than from \\Lawrence\\ that final 
disposition of a pending certiorari petition is also unnecessary to exhaust state-court remedies. 

  That the District Court had erred was no mystery to respondent in 1996. He correctly asked the District Court to 
reconsider its decision to dismiss his habeas action, and instead to stay it pending disposition of his petition for certiorari (which is the proper procedural way to handle such duplicative filings). See App. to Brief for National Association 
of Criminal Defense Lawyers as \\Amicus Curiae\\ 8–11 (hereinafter NACDL Brief). And he then filed a notice of appeal 
and unsuccessfully sought a certificate of appealability. See 
\\id.,\\ at 1–7. Respondent (who theretofore had shown himself 
to be a highly capable \\pro se\\ litigant, undoubtedly aware of 
the availability of en banc and certiorari review) simply gave 
up too early. There is no more reason in this case than in 
any other to excuse the failure to make use of all available 
means of review. Far from thinking that a petition for certiorari “would almost certainly have been futile,” \\ante,\\ at 
601, n., I think it would almost certainly have been successful. We give special attention to capital cases (as today’s 
delicate disposition shows), and since the District Court’s denial of a certificate of appealability occurred on August 1, 
1996, see App. to NACDL Brief 1, more than three months

after AEDPA’s effective date, see \\Woodford\\ v. \\Garceau,\\ 538 
U. S. 202, 204 (2003), it would have been obvious that our 
refusal to correct the District Court’s clear error would subject this defendant’s renewed request for federal habeas relief to AEDPA’s restrictions. 

  More fundamentally, however, even were the Court’s conjecture correct that diligence on respondent’s part would 
not have been rewarded, neither AEDPA nor any principle 
of law would entitle him to relief from the collateral consequences of an uncorrected judicial error. We held in 
\\Daniels\\ v. \\United States,\\ 532 U. S. 374, 382 (2001), that 
“[i]f...apriorconviction used to enhance a federal sentence 
is no longer open to direct or collateral attack in its own 
right because the defendant failed to pursue those remedies 
while they were available \\(or because the defendant did so\\ 
\\unsuccessfully)\\, then that defendant is without recourse.” 
(Emphasis added.) If a defendant is subject to \\additional\\ 
\\jail time\\ because a prior erroneous conviction went unreversed, surely respondent cannot complain about the fact 
that the District Court’s prior uncorrected error has caused 
this habeas petition to be subject to AEDPA’s entirely reasonable restrictions.[[*]]

# II

  There having been eliminated the possibility that AEDPA 
is inapplicable to this case (and hence that the question on 
which we granted certiorari and heard argument is not presented), what possible justification remains for canceling our 
grant of certiorari after full briefing and argument? There 
disappears, along with the claim of AEDPA inapplicability, 
any substance to the Court’s contention that respondent is 
“virtually identically situated” to the two other litigants with 
similar claims, and that he is being treated differently “sim@@606@@ply because the District Court erroneously dismissed [his] 
pre-AEDPA petition.” \\Ante,\\ at 601–602. No. He is being 
treated differently because he, unlike them, seeks federal habeas relief by means of a petition filed after AEDPA’s effective date. Is what happened here any less rational, any less 
fair, a basis for differential treatment than the random fact 
that one petitioner’s habeas action was filed a day before 
AEDPA’s effective date, and another petitioner’s could not 
be filed until one day after? Would the Court entertain the 
thought that if those two petitions involved the same sort of 
closing argument by the same prosecutor, the second of them 
would have to be exempted from AEDPA? If anything, the 
differential treatment is more justified here, since the later 
filing was not randomly determined, but was likely the consequence of respondent’s failure to exhaust his appeals. 

^* Of course, even if some novel argument for the inapplicability of 
AEDPA exists, respondent and the Court have not explained why the 
claim has not been waived, given that this issue was raised \\for the first\\ 
\\time\\ in respondent’s merits brief in this Court. See \\infra,\\ at 606–607. 


  The Court seems to be affected by a vague and discomforting feeling that things are different now from what they 
were when we granted certiorari. They are so only in the 
respect that we now know, as we did not then, that respondent’s earlier petition was wrongfully dismissed. That fact 
has relevance neither to the law governing this case (as discussed in Part I, \\supra\\) nor to any equities that might justify 
our bringing to naught the parties’ briefing and arguments, 
and the Justices’ deliberations, on the question for which this 
petition was granted. But what makes today’s wasteful action particularly perverse is that it is \\the fault of respondent\\ 
that we did not know of the wrongful dismissal earlier. Before we granted plenary review, respondent had \\never\\ argued that AEDPA should not apply because of the District 
Court’s error. He made no such claim either time he was 
before the Eighth Circuit. See Brief for Appellee in \\Bower­\\
\\sox\\ v. \\Weaver,\\ No. 99–3462, pp. xvii–xix; Brief for Appellee/ 
Cross-Appellant in \\Bowersox\\ v. \\Weaver,\\ No. 03–2880 etc., 
p. 7. And, more significantly, he remained completely silent 
in his brief in opposition, despite his obligation to raise the 
issue under this Court’s Rule 15.2. Indeed, even in respond@@607@@ent’s merits brief, his argument (if it can be called that) consists of three sentences explaining the procedural history followed by a conclusory assertion, all buried in footnote 44 
on page 39. 

  Respondent’s delayed invocation of this issue has not only 
not been sanctioned; it has been rewarded. Had respondent 
raised his specious claim of AEDPA inapplicability in a 
timely manner, petitioner would have had the opportunity to 
blow it out of the water. Whether by way of calculus or 
through dumb luck, respondent’s tardiness has succeeded 
in confounding the Court. We promulgated Rule 15.2 precisely to prohibit such sandbagging—and to avoid the ill 
effects that minimal briefing has on the quality of our decisionmaking, as perfectly demonstrated by this case. Respondent and his counsel should not profit from their flouting 
of this Court’s Rules. 

* * *

  I would thus answer the question on which we granted 
certiorari and received full briefing and argument. Because 
plenary review has convinced me beyond doubt that the 
Missouri Supreme Court did not unreasonably apply clearly 
established precedent of this Court, I would reverse the 
judgment of the Eighth Circuit. 

  A postscript is warranted in light of the unusual circumstances in which we dispose of this case. The greatest harm 
done by today’s cancellation is not to the State of Missouri, 
which will have to retry this murder case almost two decades 
after the original trial—though that is harm enough. The 
greatest harm is that done to AEDPA, since dismissing the 
writ of certiorari leaves the Eighth Circuit’s grossly erroneous precedent on the books. (That precedent, by the way, 
cannot be explained away—as perhaps the Court’s own opinion can—as the product of law-distorting compassion for a 
defendant wronged by a District Court’s erroneous action. 
As noted earlier, the Eighth Circuit was not informed of that 
erroneous action. It presumably really believes that this is 

@@608@@

the way AEDPA should be applied.) Other courts should 
be warned that this Court’s failure to reverse the Eighth 
Circuit’s decision is a rare manifestation of judicial clemency 
unrestrained by law. They would be well advised to do unto 
the Eighth Circuit’s decision just what it did unto AEDPA: 
ignore it. 

  For the foregoing reasons, I respectfully dissent.
