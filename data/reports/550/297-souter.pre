  <<Justice Souter,>> concurring. 

  I join the Courtâ€™s opinion. In some later case, we may be required to consider whether harmless-error review is ever appropriate in a case with error as described in \\Penry\\ v. \\Lynaugh,\\ 492 U. S. 302 (1989). We do not and need not address that question here.
