Applicants’ requests for (1) an extension of time in which to file a petition for a rehearing of this Court’s order denying certiorari and (2) a suspension of the order denying certiorari are denied. This Court’s Rules do not contemplate extending the time to file a petition for a rehearing of an order denying certiorari. See Rules 44.1, 44.2. And applicants have not satisfied the rigorous standard for suspending an order denying certiorari, a form of extraordinary relief that will not be granted unless there is a “reasonable likelihood of this Court’s reversing its previous position and granting certiorari,” \\Richmond\\ v. \\Arizona,\\ 434 U. S. 1323.
