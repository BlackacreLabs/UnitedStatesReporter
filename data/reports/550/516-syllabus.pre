Respondent school district receives federal funds under the Individuals
with Disabilities Education Act (Act or IDEA), so it must provide
children such as petitioner Winkelmans’ son Jacob a “free
appropriate public education,” 20 U. S. C. § 1400(d)(1)(A), in
accordance with an individualized education program (IEP) that the
parents, school officials, and others develop as members of the
student’s “IEP Team.” Regarding Jacob’s IEP as deficient, the
Winkelmans unsuccessfully appealed through IDEA’s administrative
review process. Proceeding without counsel, they then filed a
federal-court complaint on their own behalf and on Jacob’s behalf. The
District Court granted respondent judgment on the pleadings. The Sixth
Circuit entered an order dismissing the Winkelmans’ subsequent appeal
unless they obtained an attorney, citing Circuit precedent holding that
because the right to a free appropriate public education belongs only to
the child, and IDEA does not abrogate the common-law rule prohibiting
nonlawyer parents from representing minor children, IDEA does not allow
nonlawyer parents to proceed \\pro se\\ in federal court.

\\Held:\\

  1. IDEA grants parents independent, enforceable rights, which are not
limited to procedural and reimbursement-related matters but encompass
the entitlement to a free appropriate public education for their child.
Pp. 522–535.

    (a) IDEA’s text resolves the question whether parents or only
chil dren have rights under the Act. Proper interpretation requires
considering the entire statutory scheme. IDEA’s goals include
“ensur[ing] that all children with disabilities have available to
them a free appropriate public education” and “that the rights
of children with disabilities and parents of such children are
protected,” 20 U. S. C. §§ 1400(d)(1)(A)– (B), and many of its
terms mandate or otherwise describe parental involvement. Parents play
“a significant role,” \\Schaffer\\ v. \\Weast,\\ 546 U. S. 49,
53, in the development of each child’s IEP, see §§ 1412(a)(4),
1414(d). They are IEP team members, § 1414(d)(1)(B), and their
“concerns” “for enhancing [their child’s] education” must
be considered by @@517@@ the team, § 1414(d)(3)(A)(ii). A State
must, moreover, give “any party” who objects to the adequacy of
the education provided, the IEP’s construction, or related matter
the opportunity “to present a complaint . . . ,” § 1415(b)(6),
and engage in an administrative review process that culminates in
an “impartial due process hearing,” §1415(f)(1)(A), before a
hearing officer. “Any party aggrieved by the [hearing officer’s]
findings and decision. . . [has] the right to bring a civil action
with respect to the complaint.” § 1415(i)(2)(A). A court or hearing
officer may require a state agency “to reimburse the parents for
the cost of [private school] enrollment if. . .the agency had not
made a free appropriate public education available to the child.”
§ 1412(a)(10)(C)(ii). IDEA also governs when and to what extent a
court may award attorney’s fees, see § 1415(i)(3)(B), including an
award “to a prevailing party who is the parent of a child with a
disability,” § 1415(i)(3)(B)(i)(I). Pp. 523–526.

    (b) These various provisions accord parents independent, enforceable
rights. Parents have enforceable rights at the administrative stage,
and it would be inconsistent with the statutory scheme to bar them from
continuing to assert those rights in federal court at the adjudication
stage. Respondent argues that parental involvement is contemplated
only to the extent parents represent their child’s interests, but
this view is foreclosed by the Act’s provisions. The grammatical
structure of IDEA’s purpose of protecting “the rights of children
with disabilities and parents of such children,” §1400(d)(1)(B),
would make no sense unless “rights” refers to the parents’ rights
as well as the child’s. Other provisions confirm this view. See, \\e.
g.,\\ § 1415(a). Even if this Court were inclined to ignore the Act’s
plain text and adopt respondent’s countertextual reading, the Court
disagrees that the sole purpose driving IDEA’s involvement of parents
is to facilitate vindication of a child’s rights. It is not novel for
parents to have a recognized legal interest in their child’s education
and upbringing.

  The Act’s provisions also contradict the variation on respondent’s
argument that parents can be “parties aggrieved” for aspects of the
hearing officer’s findings and decision relating to certain procedures
and reimbursements, but not “parties aggrieved” with regard to any
challenge not implicating those limited concerns. The IEP proceedings
entitle parents to participate not only in the implementation of
IDEA’s procedures but also in the substantive formulation of their
child’s educational program. The Act also allows expansive challenge
by parents of “any matter” related to the proceedings and requires
that administrative resolution be based on whether the child “received
a free appropriate public education,” §1415(f)(3)(E), with judicial
review to follow. The text and structure of IDEA create in parents
an independent stake not only in @@518@@ the procedures and costs
implicated by the process but also in the substantive decision to be
made. Incongruous results would follow, moreover, were the Court to
accept the proposition that parents’ IDEA rights are limited to
certain nonsubstantive matters. It is difficult to disentangle the
Act’s procedural and reimbursement-related rights from its substantive
ones, and attempting to do so would impose upon parties a confusing
and onerous legal regime, one worsened by the absence of any express
guidance in IDEA concerning how a court might differentiate between
these matters. This bifurcated regime would also leave some parents
without any legal remedy. Pp. 526–533.

    (c) Respondent misplaces its reliance on \\Arlington Central
School\\ \\Dist. Bd. of Ed.\\ v. \\Murphy,\\ 548 U. S. 291, when it
contends that because IDEA was passed pursuant to the Spending Clause,
it must provide clear notice before it can be interpreted to provide
independent rights to parents. \\Arlington\\ held that IDEA had not
furnished clear notice before requiring States to reimburse experts’
fees to prevailing parties in IDEA actions. However, this case does not
invoke \\Arlington\\’s rule, for the determination that IDEA gives
parents independent, enforceable rights does not impose any substantive
condition or obligation on States that they would not otherwise be
required by law to observe. The basic measure of monetary recovery is
not expanded by recognizing that some rights repose in both the parent
and the child. Increased costs borne by States defending against suits
brought by nonlawyers do not suffice to invoke Spending Clause concerns,
particularly in light of provisions in IDEA that empower courts to award
attorney’s fees to prevailing educational agencies if a parent files
an action for an “improper purpose,” §1415(i)(3)(B)(i)(III). Pp.
533–535.

  2. The Sixth Circuit erred in dismissing the Winkelmans’ appeal
for lack of counsel. Because parents enjoy rights under IDEA, they are
entitled to prosecute IDEA claims on their own behalf. In light of this
holding, the Court need not reach petitioners’ argument concerning
whether IDEA entitles parents to litigate their child’s claims \\pro
