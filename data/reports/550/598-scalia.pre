  <<Justice Scalia,>> with whom <<Justice Thomas>> and <<Jus­>> <<tice
Alito>> join, dissenting.

  The Eighth Circuit held in this case that the Missouri Supreme Court
had unreasonably applied clearly established precedent of this Court
in concluding that certain statements made by the prosecutor during
the penalty phase of respondent’s capital trial did not rise to the
level of a due process violation. \\Weaver\\ v. \\Bowersox,\\ 438 F.
3d 832, 839–842 (2006). As the Court says, \\ante,\\ at 599, we
granted certiorari to decide whether this holding comported with the
Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 28 U. S.
C. § 2254(d)(1). We received briefing, and heard an hour’s argument,
on that question. Yet now the Court declines to answer it, dismissing
the writ as improvidently granted.

  The reason is that the Court has become “aware,” \\ante,\\
at 599, that respondent’s post-AEDPA habeas petition was filed
only because the District Court had erroneously dismissed an earlier
petition filed prior to AEDPA’s effective date, \\ante,\\ at 600,
601. Believing that respondent is “virtually identically situated”
to two other litigants whose federal habeas petitions were not governed
by AEDPA, and seeking to avoid “treat[ing the three] in a needlessly
disparate manner . . . simply because the District Court erroneously
dis@@603@@missed respondent’s pre-AEDPA petition,” the Court has
decided to let stand the Eighth Circuit’s flagrant misapplication of
AEDPA, whether or not (and without deciding whether) AEDPA governs this
case. \\Ante,\\ at 601–602.

  I fully agree with the Court that the District Court erred in
dismissing respondent’s pre-AEDPA petition, but that seems to me no
justification for aborting this argued case. The District Court’s
previous error does not affect the \\legal\\ conclusion that AEDPA
applies to this new petition. And once it is admitted that AEDPA
governs, the District Court’s error should in no way alter our prior
determination that the Eighth Circuit’s application of AEDPA deserves
our scrutiny. I discuss these two points in succession.

# I

  The Court provides no legal argument to support its assertion that
respondent has a “colorabl[e]” claim, \\ante,\\ at 601, that the
prior erroneous dismissal renders AEDPA inapplicable to this case. Nor
does respondent. See Brief for Respondent 39, n. 44. I am aware of no
authority supporting the proposition that respondent is legally or
equitably entitled to evade the collateral consequences of the District
Court’s error.

  To begin with, any resort to equity would founder on respondent’s
failure to exhaust his appeals of the District Court’s erroneous
decision. See \\ante,\\ at 601, n. The Court is untroubled by
respondent’s lack of diligence because, it says, further appellate
review “would almost certainly have been futile.” \\Ibid.\\ The
Court does not explain the basis for this pessimistic assessment, but
the reason seems to be its belief that the District Court’s error was
not clear until our recent decision in \\Lawrence\\ v. \\Florida,\\
549 U. S. 327 (2007). See \\ante,\\ at 601 (describing \\Lawrence\\ as
“clarif[ying]” the exhaustion rule).

  This seems to me quite wrong. The District Court’s error was as
apparent in 1996 as it was in \\1966.\\ In \\Fay\\ v. \\Noia,\\ @@604@@
372 U. S. 391, 435–438 (1963), we announced in no uncertain terms that
a federal habeas petitioner need not seek certiorari in order to exhaust
state-court remedies. “[N]o less an authority than Hart & Wechsler’s
The Federal Courts and the Federal System,” \\Massachusetts\\ v.
\\EPA,\\ 549 U. S. 497, 520, n. 17 (2007), has long understood \\Noia\\
to stand for that proposition. See P. Bator, D. Meltzer, P. Mishkin,
& D. Shapiro, Hart & Wechsler’s The Federal Courts and the Federal
System 1555 (3d ed. 1988); \\id.,\\ at 1446 (4th ed. 1996); \\id.,\\
at 1391 (5th ed. 2003). Indeed, \\Lawrence\\’s “clarifi[cation]”
consisted of nothing more than citing the same old pages in \\Noia.\\
See \\Lawrence, supra,\\ at 333. It logically follows from \\Noia\\ no
less inescapably than from \\Lawrence\\ that final disposition of a
pending certiorari petition is also unnecessary to exhaust state-court
remedies.

  That the District Court had erred was no mystery to respondent in
1996. He correctly asked the District Court to reconsider its decision
to dismiss his habeas action, and instead to stay it pending disposition
of his petition for certiorari (which is the proper procedural way
to handle such duplicative filings). See App. to Brief for National
Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers as \\Amicus Curiae\\ 8–11
(hereinafter NACDL Brief). And he then filed a notice of appeal and
unsuccessfully sought a certificate of appealability. See \\id.,\\ at
1–7. Respondent (who theretofore had shown himself to be a highly
capable \\pro se\\ litigant, undoubtedly aware of the availability of en
banc and certiorari review) simply gave up too early. There is no more
reason in this case than in any other to excuse the failure to make use
of all available means of review. Far from thinking that a petition for
certiorari “would almost certainly have been futile,” \\ante,\\ at
601, n., I think it would almost certainly have been successful. We give
special attention to capital cases (as today’s delicate disposition
shows), and since the District Court’s denial of a certificate of
appealability occurred on August 1, 1996, see App. to NACDL Brief 1,
more than three months @@605@@ after AEDPA’s effective date, see
\\Woodford\\ v. \\Garceau,\\ 538 U. S. 202, 204 (2003), it would have
been obvious that our refusal to correct the District Court’s clear
error would subject this defendant’s renewed request for federal
habeas relief to AEDPA’s restrictions.

  More fundamentally, however, even were the Court’s conjecture
correct that diligence on respondent’s part would not have been
rewarded, neither AEDPA nor any principle of law would entitle him to
relief from the collateral consequences of an uncorrected judicial
error. We held in \\Daniels\\ v. \\United States,\\ 532 U. S. 374,
382 (2001), that “[i]f...apriorconviction used to enhance a federal
sentence is no longer open to direct or collateral attack in its own
right because the defendant failed to pursue those remedies while they
were available \\(or because the defendant did so\\ \\unsuccessfully)\\,
then that defendant is without recourse.” (Emphasis added.) If a
defendant is subject to \\additional\\ \\jail time\\ because a prior
erroneous conviction went unreversed, surely respondent cannot complain
about the fact that the District Court’s prior uncorrected error
has caused this habeas petition to be subject to AEDPA’s entirely
reasonable restrictions.[[*]]

# II

  There having been eliminated the possibility that AEDPA is
inapplicable to this case (and hence that the question on which we
granted certiorari and heard argument is not presented), what possible
justification remains for canceling our grant of certiorari after
full briefing and argument? There disappears, along with the claim of
AEDPA inapplicability, any substance to the Court’s contention that
respondent is “virtually identically situated” to the two other
litigants with similar claims, and that he is being treated differently
“sim@@606@@ply because the District Court erroneously dismissed [his]
pre-AEDPA petition.” \\Ante,\\ at 601–602. No. He is being treated
differently because he, unlike them, seeks federal habeas relief by
means of a petition filed after AEDPA’s effective date. Is what
happened here any less rational, any less fair, a basis for differential
treatment than the random fact that one petitioner’s habeas action was
filed a day before AEDPA’s effective date, and another petitioner’s
could not be filed until one day after? Would the Court entertain the
thought that if those two petitions involved the same sort of closing
argument by the same prosecutor, the second of them would have to be
exempted from AEDPA? If anything, the differential treatment is more
justified here, since the later filing was not randomly determined, but
was likely the consequence of respondent’s failure to exhaust his
appeals.

^* Of course, even if some novel argument for the inapplicability of
AEDPA exists, respondent and the Court have not explained why the claim
has not been waived, given that this issue was raised \\for the first\\
\\time\\ in respondent’s merits brief in this Court. See \\infra,\\ at
606–607.

  The Court seems to be affected by a vague and discomforting feeling
that things are different now from what they were when we granted
certiorari. They are so only in the respect that we now know, as we did
not then, that respondent’s earlier petition was wrongfully dismissed.
That fact has relevance neither to the law governing this case (as
discussed in Part I, \\supra\\) nor to any equities that might justify
our bringing to naught the parties’ briefing and arguments, and the
Justices’ deliberations, on the question for which this petition
was granted. But what makes today’s wasteful action particularly
perverse is that it is \\the fault of respondent\\ that we did not know
of the wrongful dismissal earlier. Before we granted plenary review,
respondent had \\never\\ argued that AEDPA should not apply because of
the District Court’s error. He made no such claim either time he was
before the Eighth Circuit. See Brief for Appellee in \\Bower­\\ \\sox\\
v. \\Weaver,\\ No. 99–3462, pp. xvii–xix; Brief for Appellee/
Cross-Appellant in \\Bowersox\\ v. \\Weaver,\\ No. 03–2880 etc., p.
7. And, more significantly, he remained completely silent in his brief
in opposition, despite his obligation to raise the issue under this
Court’s Rule 15.2. Indeed, even in respond@@607@@ent’s merits brief,
his argument (if it can be called that) consists of three sentences
explaining the procedural history followed by a conclusory assertion,
all buried in footnote 44 on page 39.

  Respondent’s delayed invocation of this issue has not only not been
sanctioned; it has been rewarded. Had respondent raised his specious
claim of AEDPA inapplicability in a timely manner, petitioner would
have had the opportunity to blow it out of the water. Whether by way of
calculus or through dumb luck, respondent’s tardiness has succeeded in
confounding the Court. We promulgated Rule 15.2 precisely to prohibit
such sandbagging—and to avoid the ill effects that minimal briefing
has on the quality of our decisionmaking, as perfectly demonstrated
by this case. Respondent and his counsel should not profit from their
flouting of this Court’s Rules.

* * *

  I would thus answer the question on which we granted certiorari
and received full briefing and argument. Because plenary review has
convinced me beyond doubt that the Missouri Supreme Court did not
unreasonably apply clearly established precedent of this Court, I would
reverse the judgment of the Eighth Circuit.

  A postscript is warranted in light of the unusual circumstances in
which we dispose of this case. The greatest harm done by today’s
cancellation is not to the State of Missouri, which will have to retry
this murder case almost two decades after the original trial—though
that is harm enough. The greatest harm is that done to AEDPA, since
dismissing the writ of certiorari leaves the Eighth Circuit’s grossly
erroneous precedent on the books. (That precedent, by the way, cannot
be explained away—as perhaps the Court’s own opinion can—as
the product of law-distorting compassion for a defendant wronged by
a District Court’s erroneous action. As noted earlier, the Eighth
Circuit was not informed of that erroneous action. It presumably really
believes that this is @@608@@ the way AEDPA should be applied.) Other
courts should be warned that this Court’s failure to reverse the
Eighth Circuit’s decision is a rare manifestation of judicial clemency
unrestrained by law. They would be well advised to do unto the Eighth
Circuit’s decision just what it did unto AEDPA: ignore it.

  For the foregoing reasons, I respectfully dissent.
