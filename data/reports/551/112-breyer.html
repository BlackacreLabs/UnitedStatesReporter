<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Justice Breyer,</span> concurring in part and dissenting in part. </p>

<p>I agree with the Court that <em>Brecht</em> v. <em>Abrahamson,</em> 507 U.&nbsp;S. 619 (1993), sets forth the proper standard of review. Cf. <em>id.,</em> at 643 (<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Stevens,</span> J., concurring). At the same time, I agree with <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Justice Stevens</span> that we should consider the application of the standard, that the error was not harmless, and that “\\Chambers</em> error is by nature prejudicial.” <em>Ante,</em> at 124 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part) (citing <em>Chambers</em> v. <em>Mississippi,</em> 410 U.&nbsp;S. 284 (1973)). Cf. <em>Kyles</em> v. <em>Whitley,</em> 514 U.&nbsp;S. 419, 435 (1995) (similar statement as to errors under <em>Brady</em> v. <em>Maryland,</em> 373 U.S. 83 (1963)). Nonetheless, I would remand this case rather than reversing the Court of Appeals. </p>

<p>My reason arises out of the fact that here, for purposes of deciding whether <em>Chambers</em> error exists, the question of harm is inextricably tied to other aspects of the trial court’s determination. The underlying evidentiary judgment at issue involved a weighing of the probative value of proffered evidence against, <em>e. g.,</em> its cumulative nature, its tendency to confuse or to prejudice the jury, or the likelihood that it will simply waste the jury’s time. See App. 96–97; Cal. Evid. Code Ann. §&nbsp;352 (West 1995); cf. Fed. Rule Evid. 403. In this context, to find a <em>Chambers</em> error a court must take account <em>both</em> of the way in which (and extent to which) the trial court misweighed the relevant admissibility factors <em>and</em> of the extent to which doing so harmed the defendant. Moreover, to find this kind of error harmless, as the Court of Appeals found it, should preclude the possibility of a <em>Chambers</em> error; but to find this kind of error harmful does not guarantee the contrary. A garden-variety nonharmless misapplication of evidentiary principles normally will not rise to the level of a constitutional, <em>Chambers,</em> mistake. Cf., <em>e. g., United States</em> v. <em>Scheffer,</em> 523 U.&nbsp;S. 303, 308 (1998). </p>

<p>All this, it seems to me, requires reconsideration by the Court of Appeals of its <em>Chambers</em> determination. I would <span class="break">127</span> not consider the question whether that exclusion of evidence amounted to <em>Chambers</em> error because that question is not before us, see <em>ante,</em> at 116–117, n. 1 (opinion of the Court). But the logically inseparable question of harm is before us; and that, I believe, is sufficient. </p>

<p>I would remand the case to the Ninth Circuit so that, taking account of the points <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Justice Stevens</span> raises, <em>ante,</em> at 122–125, it can reconsider whether there was an error of admissibility sufficiently serious to violate <em>Chambers.</em> I therefore join the Court’s opinion except as to footnote 1 and Part II–B, and I join <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Justice Stevens</span>’ opinion in part.</p>
