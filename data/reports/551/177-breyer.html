	  I agree with the Court that the Supreme Court of Washington’s decision rested entirely on flawed interpretations of this Court’s agency-fee cases and our decision in <em>Boy Scoutsof America</em> v. <em>Dale,</em> 530 U.&nbsp;S. 640 (2000). I therefore concur in the Court’s judgment, and I join Parts I and II–A and the second paragraph of footnote 2 of the Court’s opinion. However, I do not join Part II–B, which addresses numerous arguments that respondent Washington Education Association raised for the first time in its briefs before this Court. See, <em>e. g., State ex rel. Washington State Public DisclosureComm’n</em> v. <em>Washington Ed. Assn.,</em> 156 Wash. 2d 543, 565, n. 6, 130 P. 3d 352, 362, n. 6, (2006) (en banc) (noting that one of these arguments was neither raised nor addressed below). I would not address those arguments until the lower courts have been given the opportunity to address them. See, <em>e. g.,National Collegiate Athletic Assn.</em> v. <em>Smith,</em> 525 U.&nbsp;S. 459, 469–470 (1999).
