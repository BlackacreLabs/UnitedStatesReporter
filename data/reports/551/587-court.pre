  <<Justice Alito>> announced the judgment of the Court and delivered an
opinion, in which <<The Chief Justice>> and <<Justice Kennedy>> join.

  This is a lawsuit in which it was claimed that conferences held as
part of the President’s Faith-Based and Community Initiatives program
violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment because, among
other things, President Bush and former Secretary of Education Paige
gave speeches that used “religious imagery” and praised the efficacy
of faith-based programs in delivering social services.

The plaintiffs contend that they meet the standing requirements of
Article III of the Constitution because they pay federal taxes.

  It has long been established, however, that the payment of taxes
is generally not enough to establish standing to challenge an action
taken by the Federal Government. In light of the size of the federal
budget, it is a complete fiction to argue that an unconstitutional
federal expenditure causes an individual federal taxpayer any measurable
economic harm. And if every federal taxpayer could sue to challenge
any Government expenditure, the federal courts would cease to function
as courts of law and would be cast in the role of general complaint
bureaus.

  In \\Flast\\ v. \\Cohen,\\ 392 U. S. 83 (1968), we recognized a
narrow exception to the general rule against federal taxpayer standing.
Under \\Flast,\\ a plaintiff asserting an Establishment Clause claim
has standing to challenge a law authorizing the use of federal funds in
a way that allegedly violates the Establishment Clause. In the present
case, Congress did not specifically authorize the use of federal funds
to pay for the conferences or speeches that the plaintiffs challenged.
Instead, the conferences and speeches were paid for out of general
Executive Branch appropriations. The Court of Appeals, however, held
that the plaintiffs have standing as taxpayers because the conferences
were paid for with money appropriated by Congress.

  The question that is presented here is whether this broad reading of
\\Flast\\ is correct. We hold that it is not. We therefore reverse the
decision of the Court of Appeals.

## A

  In 2001, the President issued an executive order creating the
White House Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives within
the Executive Office of the President. Exec. Order No. 13199, 3 CFR
752 (2001 Comp.). The purpose of @@594@@ this new office was to
ensure that “private and charitable community groups, including
religious ones . . . have the fullest opportunity permitted by law
to compete on a level playing field, so long as they achieve valid
public purposes” and adhere to “the bedrock principles of pluralism,
nondiscrimination, evenhandedness, and neutrality.” \\Ibid.\\ The
office was specifically charged with the task of eliminating unnecessary
bureaucratic, legislative, and regulatory barriers that could impede
such organizations’ effectiveness and ability to compete equally for
federal assistance. \\Id.,\\ at 752–753.

  By separate executive orders, the President also created Executive
Department Centers for Faith-Based and Community Initiatives within
several federal agencies and departments.[[1]] These centers were given
the job of ensuring that faith-based community groups would be eligible
to compete for federal financial support without impairing their
independence or autonomy, as long as they did “not use direct Federal
financial assistance to support any inherently religious activities,
such as worship, religious instruction, or proselytization.”
Exec. Order No. 13279, 3 CFR §2(f), p. 260 (2002 Comp.). To this
end, the President directed that “[n]o organization should be
discriminated against on the basis of religion or religious belief in
the administration or distribution of Federal financial assistance under
social service programs,” \\id.,\\ § 2(c), at 260, and that “[a]ll
organizations that receive Federal financial assistance under social
services programs should be prohibited from discriminating against
beneficiaries or potential beneficiaries of the social services programs
on the basis of religion or religious belief,” \\id.,\\ § 2(d), at
260. Petitioners, who have been sued in their official capacities, are
the directors of the White House Office and various Executive Department
Centers. @@595@@

^1 See, \\e. g.,\\ Exec. Order No. 13198, 3 CFR 750 (2001 Comp.); Exec.
Order No. 13280, 3 CFR 262 (2002 Comp.); Exec. Order No. 13342, 3 CFR
180 (2004 Comp.); Exec. Order No. 13397, 71 Fed. Reg. 12275 (2006).

  No congressional legislation specifically authorized the creation of
the White House Office or the Executive Department Centers. Rather,
they were “created entirely within the executive branch . . . by
Presidential executive order.” \\Freedom From Religion Foundation,
Inc.\\ v. \\Chao,\\ 433 F. 3d 989, 997 (CA7 2006). Nor has Congress
enacted any law specifically appropriating money for these entities’
activities. Instead, their activities are funded through general
Executive Branch appropriations. For example, the Department of
Education’s Center is funded from money appropriated for the Office of
the Secretary of Education, while the Department of Housing and Urban
Development’s Center is funded through that Department’s salaries
and expenses account. See GAO, Faith-Based and Community Initiative:

  The respondents are Freedom From Religion Foundation, Inc., a nonstock
corporation “opposed to government endorsement of religion,”
\\id.,\\ ¶ 5, App. to Pet. for Cert. 68a, and three of its members.
Respondents brought suit in the United States District Court for the
Western District of Wisconsin, alleging that petitioners violated the
Establishment Clause by organizing conferences at which faith-based
organizations allegedly “are singled out as being particularly
worthy of federal funding . . . , and the belief in God is extolled
as distinguishing the claimed effectiveness of faithbased social
services.” \\Id.,\\ ¶ 32, App. to Pet. for Cert. 73a. Respondents
further alleged that the content of these conferences sent a message to
religious believers “that they are insiders and favored members of the
political community” @@596@@ and that the conferences sent the message
to nonbelievers “that they are outsiders” and “not full members
of the political community.” \\Id.,\\ ¶ 37, App. to Pet. for Cert.
76a. In short, respondents alleged that the conferences were designed
to promote, and had the effect of promoting, religious community groups
over secular ones.

  The only asserted basis for standing was that the individual
respondents are federal taxpayers who are “opposed to the use
of Congressional taxpayer appropriations to advance and promote
religion.” \\Id.,\\ ¶ 10, App. to Pet. for Cert. 69a; see also
\\id.,\\ ¶¶ 7–9, App. to Pet. for Cert. 68a–69a. In their capacity
as federal taxpayers, respondents sought to challenge Executive Branch
expenditures for these conferences, which, they contended, violated the
Establishment Clause.

## C

  The District Court dismissed the claims against petitioners for
lack of standing. See \\Freedom From ReligionFoundation, Inc.\\ v.
\\Towey,\\ No. 04–C–381–S (WD Wis., Nov. 15, 2004), App. to
Pet. for Cert. 27a–35a. It concluded that under \\Flast,\\ 392
U. S. 83, federal taxpayer standing is limited to Establishment
Clause challenges to the constitutionality of “ ‘exercises of
congressional power under the taxing and spending clause of Art. I,
§ 8.’ ” App. to Pet. for Cert. 31a (quoting \\Flast, supra,\\ at
102). Because petitioners in this case acted “at the President’s
request and on the President’s behalf” and were not “charged with
the administration of a congressional program,” the District Court
concluded that the challenged activities were “not ‘exercises of
congressional power’ ” sufficient to provide a basis for taxpayer
standing under \\Flast.\\ App. to Pet. for Cert. 33a–34a.

  A divided panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh
Circuit reversed. 433 F. 3d 989. The majority read \\Flast\\ as
granting federal taxpayers standing to challenge Executive Branch
programs on Establishment Clause grounds so long as the activities are
“financed by a congres@@597@@sional appropriation.” 433 F. 3d, at
997. This was the case, the majority concluded, even where “there is
no statutory program” enacted by Congress and the funds are “from
appropriations for the general administrative expenses, over which
the President and other executive branch officials have a degree of
discretionary power.” \\Id.,\\ at 994. According to the majority, a
taxpayer has standing to challenge anything done by a federal agency or
officer so long as “the marginal or incremental cost to the taxpaying
public of the alleged violation of the establishment clause” is
greater than “zero.” \\Id.,\\ at 995.

  In dissent, Judge Ripple opined that the majority’s decision
reflected a “dramatic expansion of current standing doctrine,”
\\id.,\\ at 997, that “cuts the concept of taxpayer standing
loose from its moorings,” \\id.,\\ at 998. Noting that “[t]he
executive can do nothing without general budget appropriations
from Congress,” \\id.,\\ at 1000, he criticized the majority for
overstepping \\Flast\\’s requirement that a “plaintiff must bring
an attack against a disbursement of public funds made in the exercise
of \\Congress’\\ taxing and spending power,” 433 F. 3d, at 1000
(emphasis in original).

  The Court of Appeals denied en banc review by a vote of 7to4.
\\Freedom From Religion Foundation, Inc.\\ v. \\Chao,\\ 447 F. 3d 988
(CA7 2006). Concurring in the denial of rehearing, Chief Judge Flaum
expressed doubt about the panel decision, but noted that “the obvious
tension which has evolved in this area of jurisprudence . . . can only
be resolved by the Supreme Court.” \\Ibid.\\ We granted certiorari to
resolve this question, 549 U. S. 1074 (2006), and we now reverse.

  Article III of the Constitution limits the judicial power
of the United States to the resolution of “Cases” and
“Controversies,” and “ ‘Article III standing . . . enforces
the Con@@598@@stitution’s case-or-controversy requirement.’ ”
\\Daimler-Chrysler Corp.\\ v. \\Cuno,\\ 547 U. S. 332, 342 (2006)
(quoting \\Elk Grove Unified School Dist.\\ v. \\Newdow,\\ 542 U.S. 1,
11 (2004)). “ ‘No principle is more fundamental to the judiciary’s
proper role in our system of government than the constitutional
limitation of federal-court jurisdiction to actual cases or
controversies.’ ” \\Raines\\ v. \\Byrd,\\ 521 U. S. 811, 818 (1997)
(quoting \\Simon\\ v. \\Eastern Ky. Welfare Rights Organization,\\ 426
U. S. 26, 37 (1976)).

  “[O]ne of the controlling elements in the definition of a case
or controversy under Article III” is standing. \\ASARCO Inc.\\ v.
\\Kadish,\\ 490 U. S. 605, 613 (1989) (opinion of <<Kennedy,>> J.).
The requisite elements of Article III standing are well established:
“A plaintiff must allege personal injury fairly traceable to the
defendant’s allegedly unlawful conduct and likely to be redressed by
the requested relief.” \\Allen\\ v. \\Wright,\\ 468 U. S. 737, 751
(1984).

  The constitutionally mandated standing inquiry is especially important
in a case like this one, in which taxpayers seek “to challenge laws
of general application where their own injury is not distinct from
that suffered in general by other taxpayers or citizens.” \\ASARCO,
supra,\\ at 613 (opinion of <<Kennedy,>> J.)\\.\\ This is because
“[t]he judicial power of the United States defined by Art. III is
not an unconditioned authority to determine the constitutionality of
legislative or executive acts.” \\Valley Forge Christian College\\
v. \\Americans United for Separation of Church and State, Inc.,\\
454 U. S. 464, 471 (1982). The federal courts are not empowered to
seek out and strike down any governmental act that they deem to be
repugnant to the Constitution. Rather, federal courts sit “solely,
to decide on the rights of individuals,” \\Marbury\\ v. \\Madison,\\
1 Cranch 137, 170 (1803), and must “ ‘refrai[n] from passing upon
the constitutionality of an act . . . unless obliged to do so in the
proper performance of our judicial function, when the question is raised
by a party whose interests entitle him to raise it,’ ” \\Valley
Forge,\\ @@599@@ \\supra,\\ at 474 (quoting \\Blair\\ v. \\United
States,\\ 250 U. S. 273, 279 (1919)). As we held over 80 years ago, in
another case involving the question of taxpayer standing:

    “We have no power \\per se\\ to review and annul acts of Congress
on the ground that they are unconstitutional. That question may be
considered only when the justification for some direct injury suffered
or threatened, presenting a justiciable issue, is made to rest upon
such an act. . . . The party who invokes the power must be able to
show not only that the statute is invalid but that he has sustained or
is immediately in danger of sustaining some direct injury as the result
of its enforcement, and not merely that he suffers in some indefinite
way in common with people generally.” \\Frothingham\\ v. \\Mellon,\\
decided with \\Massachusetts\\ v. \\Mellon,\\ 262 U. S. 447, 488
(1923).

## B

 As a general matter, the interest of a federal taxpayer in seeing that
Treasury funds are spent in accordance with the Constitution does not
give rise to the kind of redressable “personal injury” required for
Article III standing. Of course, a taxpayer has standing to challenge
the \\collection\\ of a specific tax assessment as unconstitutional;
being forced to pay such a tax causes a real and immediate economic
injury to the individual taxpayer. See, \\e. g., Follett\\ v. \\Townof
McCormick,\\ 321 U. S. 573 (1944) (invalidating tax on preaching
on First Amendment grounds). But that is not the interest on which
respondents assert standing here. Rather, their claim is that, having
paid lawfully collected taxes into the Federal Treasury at some point,
they have a continuing, legally cognizable interest in ensuring that
those funds are not \\used\\ by the Government in a way that violates
the Constitution.

  We have consistently held that this type of interest is too
generalized and attenuated to support Article III standing. @@600@@
In \\Frothingham,\\ a federal taxpayer sought to challenge federal
appropriations for mothers’ and children’s health, arguing that
federal involvement in this area intruded on the rights reserved to
the States under the Tenth Amendment and would “increase the burden
of future taxation and thereby take [the plaintiff’s] property
without due process of law.” 262 U. S., at 486. We concluded that the
plaintiff lacked the kind of particularized injury required for Article
III standing:

    “[I]nterest in the moneys of the Treasury . . . is shared with
millions of others; is comparatively minute and indeterminable; and the
effect upon future taxation, of any payment out of the funds, so remote,
fluctuating and uncertain, that no basis is afforded for an appeal to
the preventive powers of a court of equity.

      “The administration of any statute, likely to produce additional
taxation to be imposed upon a vast number of taxpayers, the extent
of whose several liability is indefinite and constantly changing,
is essentially a matter of public and not of individual concern.”
\\Id.,\\ at 487.

  Because the interests of the taxpayer are, in essence, the interests
of the public at large, deciding a constitutional claim based solely on
taxpayer standing “would be[,] not to decide a judicial controversy,
but to assume a position of authority over the governmental acts of
another and co-equal department, an authority which plainly we do
not possess.” \\Id.,\\ at 489; see also \\Alabama Power Co.\\ v.
\\Ickes,\\ 302 U. S. 464, 478–479 (1938).

  In \\Doremus\\ v. \\Board of Ed. of Hawthorne,\\ 342 U. S. 429,
433 (1952), we reaffirmed this principle, explaining that “the
interests of a taxpayer in the moneys of the federal treasury are too
indeterminable, remote, uncertain and indirect to furnish a basis for
an appeal to the preventive powers of the Court over their manner of
expenditure.” We therefore rejected a state taxpayer’s claim of
standing to challenge a @@601@@ state law authorizing public school
teachers to read from the Bible because “the grievance which [the
plaintiff] sought to litigate . . . isnot a direct dollars-and-cents injury
but is a religious difference.” \\Id.,\\ at 434. In so doing, we gave
effect to the basic constitutional principle that

    “a plaintiff raising only a generally available grievance about
government—claiming only harm to his and every citizen’s interest in
proper application of the Constitution and laws, and seeking relief that
no more directly and tangibly benefits him than it does the public at
large—does not state an Article III case or controversy.” \\Lujan\\

## C

  In \\Flast,\\ the Court carved out a narrow exception to the
general constitutional prohibition against taxpayer standing. The
taxpayer-plaintiffs in that case challenged the distribution of federal
funds to religious schools under the Elementary and Secondary Education
Act of 1965, alleging that such aid violated the Establishment Clause.
The Court set out a two-part test for determining whether a federal
taxpayer has standing to challenge an allegedly unconstitutional
expenditure:

    “First, the taxpayer must establish a logical link between that
    status and the type of legislative enactment attacked. Thus, a
    taxpayer will be a proper party to allege the unconstitutionality
    only of exercises of congressional power under the taxing and
    spending clause of Art. I, § 8, of the Constitution. It will not
    be sufficient to allege an incidental expenditure of tax funds in
    the administration of an essentially regulatory statute. . . .
    Secondly, the taxpayer must establish a nexus between that status
    and the precise nature of the constitutional infringement alleged.
    Under this requirement, the taxpayer must show that the challenged
    enactment exceeds specific constitutional limitations imposed upon
    the exercise of the congressional taxing and spending power and not
    simply that the enactment is generally beyond the powers delegated
    to Congress by Art. I, § 8.” 392 U. S., at 102–103.

  The Court held that the taxpayer-plaintiffs in \\Flast\\ had satisfied
both prongs of this test: The plaintiff’s “constitutional challenge
[was] made to an exercise by Congress of its @@603@@ power under Art.
I, § 8, to spend for the general welfare,” and she alleged a
violation of the Establishment Clause, which “operates as a specific
constitutional limitation upon the exercise by Congress of the taxing
and spending power conferred by Art. I, § 8.” \\Id.,\\ at 103–104.

# III

## A

  Respondents argue that this case falls within the \\Flast\\ exception,
which they read to cover any “expenditure of government funds in
violation of the Establishment Clause.” Brief for Respondents 12.
But this broad reading fails to observe “the rigor with which the
\\Flast\\ exception to the \\Frothingham\\ principle ought to be
applied.” \\Valley Forge,\\ 454 U. S., at 481.

  The expenditures at issue in \\Flast\\ were made pursuant to
an express congressional mandate and a specific congressional
appropriation. The plaintiff in that case challenged disbursements made
under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, 79 Stat. 27.
That Act expressly appropriated the sum of $100 million for fiscal
year 1966, § 201(b), \\id.,\\ at 36, and authorized the disbursement
of those funds to local educational agencies for the education of
lowincome students, see \\Flast, supra,\\ at 86. The Act mandated that
local educational agencies receiving such funds “ma[k]e provision for
including special educational services and arrangements (such as dual
enrollment, educational radio and television, and mobile educational
services and equipment)” in which students enrolled in private
elementary and secondary schools could participate, § 2, 79 Stat.
30–31. In addition, recipient agencies were required to ensure that
“library resources, textbooks, and other instructional materials”
funded through the grants “be provided on an equitable basis for
the use of children and teachers in private elementary and secondary
schools,” § 203(a)(3)(B), \\id.,\\ at 37. @@604@@

  The expenditures challenged in \\Flast,\\ then, were funded by a
specific congressional appropriation and were disbursed to private
schools (including religiously affiliated schools) pursuant to a
direct and unambiguous congressional mandate.[[3]] Indeed, the
\\Flast\\ taxpayer-plaintiffs’ constitutional claim was premised on
the contention that if the Government’s actions were “ ‘within
the authority and intent of the Act, the Act is to that extent
unconstitutional and void.’ ” \\Flast, supra,\\ at 90. And the
judgment reviewed by this Court in \\Flast\\ solely concerned the
question whether “if [the challenged] expenditures are authorized by
the Act the statute constitutes a ‘law respecting an establishment of
religion’ and a law ‘prohibiting the free exercise thereof’”
under the First Amendment. \\Flast\\ v. \\Gardner,\\ 271 F. Supp. 1, 2
(SDNY 1967).

  Given that the alleged Establishment Clause violation in \\Flast\\
was funded by a specific congressional appropriation and was undertaken
pursuant to an express congressional mandate, the Court concluded that
the taxpayer-plaintiffs had established the requisite “logical link
between [their taxpayer] status and the type of legislative enactment
attacked.” In the Court’s words, “[t]heir constitutional challenge
[was] made to an exercise by Congress of its power under Art. I, § 8,
to spend for the general welfare.” 392 U. S., at 102, 103. But as this
Court later noted, \\Flast\\ “limited taxpayer standing to challenges
directed ‘only [at] exercises of congressional power’ ” under the
Taxing and Spending Clause. \\Valley Forge, supra,\\ at 479. @@605@@

^3 At around the time the Act was passed and \\Flast\\ was decided,
the great majority of nonpublic elementary and secondary schools in
the United States were associated with a church. In 1965–1966, for
example, 91.1 percent of all nonpublic elementary schools and 78.2
percent of all nonpublic secondary schools in the United States were
religiously affiliated. Dept. of Health, Education, and Welfare,
Statistics of Nonpublic Elementary and Secondary Schools 1965–66, p. 7
(1968). Congress surely understood that much of the aid mandated by the
statute would find its way to religious schools.

## B

  The link between congressional action and constitutional violation
that supported taxpayer standing in \\Flast\\ is missing here.
Respondents do not challenge any specific congressional action or
appropriation; nor do they ask the Court to invalidate any congressional
enactment or legislatively created program as unconstitutional. That
is because the expenditures at issue here were not made pursuant to
any Act of Congress. Rather, Congress provided general appropriations
to the Executive Branch to fund its day-to-day activities.[[4]] These
appropriations did not expressly authorize, direct, or even mention the
expenditures of which respondents complain. Those expenditures resulted
from executive discretion, not congressional action.

  We have never found taxpayer standing under such circumstances. In
\\Valley Forge,\\ we held that a taxpayer lacked standing to challenge
“a decision by [the federal Department of Health, Education and
Welfare] to transfer a parcel of federal property” to a religious
college because this transfer was “not a congressional action.”
454 U. S., at 479. In fact, the connection to congressional action was
closer in \\Valley Forge\\ than it is here, because in that case, the
“particular Executive Branch action” being challenged was at least
“arguably authorized” by the Federal Property and Administrative
Services Act of 1949, which permitted federal agencies to transfer
surplus property to private entities. \\Ibid.,\\ n. 15. Nevertheless, we
found that the plaintiffs lacked standing because \\Flast\\ “limited
taxpayer standing to challenges directed ‘only [at] exercises of
congressional power’ ” under the Taxing and Spending Clause. 454 U.
S., at 479 (quoting \\Flast, supra,\\ at 102).[[5]] @@606@@

^4 See, \\e. g.,\\ 119 Stat. 2472 (appropriating $53,830,000 “to
be available for allocation within the Executive Office of the
President”).

^5 \\Valley Forge\\ also relied on a second rationale: that the
authorizing Act was an exercise of Congress’ power under the Property
Clause of Art. IV, § 3, cl. 2, and not the Taxing and Spending Clause
of Art. I, § 8. 454 U. S., @@605@@ at 480. But this conclusion
merely provided an additional—“and perhaps redundan[t],”
\\ibid.\\—basis for denying a claim of standing that was already
foreclosed because it was not based on any congressional action.

  Similarly, in \\Schlesinger\\ v. \\Reservists Comm. to Stop theWar,\\
418 U. S. 208 (1974), the taxpayer-plaintiffs contended that the
Incompatibility Clause of Article I prohibited Members of Congress
from holding commissions in the Armed Forces Reserve. We held that
these plaintiffs lacked standing under \\Flast\\ because they “did
not challenge an enactment under Art. I, § 8, but rather the action
of the Executive Branch in permitting Members of Congress to maintain
their Reserve status.” 418 U. S., at 228. This was the case even
though the plaintiffs sought to reclaim reservist pay received by those
Members—pay that presumably was funded through Congress’ general
appropriations for the support of the Armed Forces: “Such relief would
follow from the invalidity of Executive action in paying persons who
could not lawfully have been reservists, not from the invalidity of
the statutes authorizing pay to those who lawfully were Reservists.”
\\Ibid.,\\ n. 17. See also \\United States\\ v. \\Richardson,\\ 418
U. S. 166, 175 (1974) (denying taxpayers standing to compel publication
of accounting for the Central Intelligence Agency because “there is
no ‘logical nexus’ between the asserted status of taxpayer and the
claimed failure of the Congress to require the Executive to supply a
more detailed report of the expenditures of that agency”).

  \\Bowen\\ v. \\Kendrick,\\ 487 U. S. 589 (1988), on which respondents
rely heavily, is not to the contrary. In that case, we held that the
taxpayer-plaintiffs had standing to mount an as-applied challenge to the
Adolescent Family Life Act (AFLA), which authorized federal grants to
private community service groups including religious organizations. The
Court found “a sufficient nexus between the taxpayer’s standing as a
taxpayer and the congressional exercise of taxing and spending power,”
notwithstanding the fact that “the funding authorized by Congress
ha[d] flowed through @@607@@ and been administered” by an Executive
Branch official. \\Id.,\\ at 620, 619.

  But the key to that conclusion was the Court’s recognition that
AFLA was “at heart a program of disbursement of funds pursuant to
Congress’ taxing and spending powers,” and that the plaintiffs’
claims “call[ed] into question how the funds authorized by
Congress [were] being disbursed \\pursuant to the AFLA’s statutory
mandate.\\” \\Id.,\\ at 619–620 (emphasis added). AFLA not only
expressly authorized and appropriated specific funds for grantmaking,
it also expressly contemplated that some of those moneys might go to
projects involving religious groups. See \\id.,\\ at 595–596; see also
\\id.,\\ at 623 (O’Connor, J., concurring) (noting the “partnership
between governmental and religious institutions contemplated by the
AFLA”).[[6]] Unlike this case, \\Kendrick\\ involved a “program
of disbursement of funds pursuant to Congress’ taxing and spending
powers” that “Congress had created,” “authorized,” and
“mandate[d].” \\Id.,\\ at 619–620.

  Respondents attempt to paint their lawsuit as a \\Kendrick\\-style
as-applied challenge, but this effort is unavailing for the simple
reason that they can cite no statute whose application they
challenge. The best they can do is to point to unspecified, lump-sum
“Congressional budget appropriations” for the general use of the
Executive Branch— the allocation of which “is a[n] administrative
decision @@608@@ traditionally regarded as committed to agency
discretion.” \\Lincoln\\ v. \\Vigil,\\ 508 U. S. 182, 192 (1993).
Characterizing this case as an “as-applied challenge” to these
general appropriations statutes would stretch the meaning of that term
past its breaking point. It cannot be that every legal challenge to a
discretionary Executive Branch action implicates the constitutionality
of the underlying congressional appropriation. When a criminal defendant
charges that a federal agent carried out an unreasonable search or
seizure, we do not view that claim as an as-applied challenge to the
constitutionality of the statute appropriating funds for the Federal
Bureau of Investigation. Respondents have not established why the
discretionary Executive Branch expenditures here, which are similarly
funded by no-strings, lump-sum appropriations, should be viewed any
differently.[[7]] @@609@@ tween taxpayer status “and the type of
legislative enactment attacked,” \\Flast,\\ 392 U. S., at 102.

^6 For example, the statute noted that the problems of adolescent
premarital sex and pregnancy “are best approached through a variety
of integrated and essential services provided to adolescents and their
families” by “religious and charitable organizations,” among
other groups. 42 U. S. C. § 300z(a)(8)(B) (1982 ed.). It went
on to mandate that federally provided services in that area should
“emphasize the provision of support by other family members, religious
and charitable organizations, voluntary associations, and other
groups.” §300z(a)(10)(C). And it directed that demonstration projects
funded by the government “shall . . . make use of support systems”
such as religious organizations, § 300z–2(a), and required grant
applicants to describe how they would “involve religious and
charitable organizations” in their projects, § 300z–5(a)(21)(B).
In short, this case falls outside “the narrow exception” that
\\Flast\\ “created to the general rule against taxpayer standing
established in \\Frothingham.\\” \\Kendrick, supra,\\ at 618.
Because the expenditures that respondents challenge were not expressly
authorized or mandated by any specific congressional enactment,
respondents’ lawsuit is not directed at an exercise of congressional
power, see \\Valley Forge,\\ 454 U. S., at 479, and thus lacks the
requisite “logical nexus” be

^7 Nor is it relevant that Congress may have informally “earmarked”
portions of its general Executive Branch appropriations to fund the
offices and centers whose expenditures are at issue here. See, \\e.
g.,\\ H. R. Rep. No. 107–342, p. 108 (2001). “[A] fundamental
principle of appropriations law is that where ‘Congress merely
appropriates lump-sum amounts without statutorily restricting what can
be done with those funds, a clear inference arises that it does not
intend to impose legally binding restrictions, and indicia in committee
reports and other legislative history as to how the funds should or are
expected to be spent do not establish any legal requirements on’ the
agency.” \\Lincoln,\\ 508 U. S., at 192 (quoting \\In reLTV Aerospace
Corp.,\\ 55 Comp. Gen. 307, 319 (1975)); see also \\TVA\\ v. \\Hill,\\

requests for appropriations cannot be equated with statutes enacted by
Congress”).

  Respondents argue that it is “arbitrary” to distinguish between
money spent pursuant to congressional mandate and expenditures made in
the course of executive discretion, because “the injury to taxpayers
in both situations is the very injury targeted by the Establishment
Clause and \\Flast\\—the expenditure for the support of religion of
funds exacted from taxpayers.” Brief for Respondents 13. The panel
majority below agreed, based on its observation that “there is so much
that executive officials could do to promote religion in ways forbidden
by the establishment clause.” 433 F. 3d, at 995.

  But \\Flast\\ focused on congressional action, and we must decline
this invitation to extend its holding to encompass discretionary
Executive Branch expenditures. \\Flast\\ itself distinguished the
“incidental expenditure of tax funds in the administration of an
essentially regulatory statute,” 392 U. S., at 102, and we have
subsequently rejected the view that taxpayer standing “extends to
‘the Government as a whole, regardless of which branch is at work in
a particular instance,’ ” \\Valley Forge, supra,\\ at 484, n. 20.
Moreover, we have repeatedly emphasized that the \\Flast\\ exception
has a “narrow application in our precedent,” \\Cuno,\\ 547 U. S.,
at 348, that only “slightly lowered” the bar on taxpayer standing,
\\Richardson,\\ 418 U. S., at 173, and that must be applied with
“rigor,” \\Valley Forge, supra,\\ at 481.

  It is significant that, in the four decades since its creation, the
\\Flast\\ exception has largely been confined to its facts. We have
declined to lower the taxpayer standing bar in suits alleging violations
of any constitutional provision apart from the Establishment Clause.
See \\Tilton\\ v. \\Richardson,\\ 403 U. S. 672 (1971) (no taxpayer
standing to sue under Free Ex@@610@@ercise Clause of First Amendment);
\\Richardson,\\ 418 U. S., at 175 (no taxpayer standing to sue under
Statement and Account Clause of Art. I); \\Schlesinger,\\ 418 U. S.,
at 228 (no taxpayer standing to sue under Incompatibility Clause of
Art. I); \\Cuno, supra,\\ at 349 (no taxpayer standing to sue under
Commerce Clause). We have similarly refused to extend \\Flast\\ to
permit taxpayer standing for Establishment Clause challenges that do
not implicate Congress’ taxing and spending power. See \\Valley
Forge, supra,\\ at 479–482 (no taxpayer standing to challenge
Executive Branch action taken pursuant to Property Clause of Art.
IV); see also \\District of Columbia Common Cause\\ v. \\District of
Columbia,\\ 858 F. 2d 1, 3–4 (CADC 1988); \\In re United States
CatholicConference,\\ 885 F. 2d 1020, 1028 (CA2 1989). In effect, we
have adopted the position set forth by Justice Powell in his concurrence
in \\Richardson\\ and have “limit[ed] the expansion of federal
taxpayer and citizen standing in the absence of specific statutory
authorization to an outer boundary drawn by the \\results\\ in \\Flast\\
 . . . .” 418 U.S., at 196.

  While respondents argue that Executive Branch expenditures in support
of religion are no different from legislative extractions, \\Flast\\
itself rejected this equivalence: “It will not be sufficient to allege
an incidental expenditure of tax funds in the administration of an
essentially regulatory statute.” 392 U. S., at 102.

  Because almost all Executive Branch activity is ultimately funded by
some congressional appropriation, extending the \\Flast\\ exception to
purely executive expenditures would effectively subject every federal
action—be it a conference, proclamation, or speech—to Establishment
Clause challenge by any taxpayer in federal court. To see the wide
swathe of activity that respondents’ proposed rule would cover,
one need look no further than the amended complaint in this action,
which focuses largely on speeches and presentations @@611@@ made by
Executive Branch officials. See, \\e. g.,\\ Amended Complaint ¶ 32,
App. to Pet. for Cert. 73a (challenging Executive Branch officials’
“support of national and regional conferences”); \\id.,\\ ¶ 33,
App. to Pet. for Cert. 73a–75a (challenging content of speech by
Secretary of Education); \\id.,\\ ¶¶ 35, 36, App. to Pet. for Cert.
76a (challenging content of Presidential speeches); \\id.,\\ ¶ 41,
App. to Pet. for Cert. 77a (challenging Executive Branch officials’
“public appearances” and “speeches”). Such a broad reading would
ignore the first prong of \\Flast\\’s standing test, which requires
“a logical link between [taxpayer] status and the type of legislative
enactment attacked.” 392 U. S., at 102.

  It would also raise serious separation-of-powers concerns. As we have
recognized, \\Flast\\ itself gave too little weight to these concerns.
By framing the standing question solely in terms of whether the dispute
would be presented in an adversary context and in a form traditionally
viewed as capable of judicial resolution, \\Flast\\ “failed to
recognize that this doctrine has a separation-of-powers component, which
keeps courts within certain traditional bounds vis-a`-vis the other
branches, concrete adverseness or not.” \\Lewis\\ v. \\Casey,\\ 518
U. S. 343, 353, n. 3 (1996); see also \\Valley Forge,\\ 454 U. S., at
471. Respondents’ position, if adopted, would repeat and compound this
mistake.

  The constitutional requirements for federal-court
jurisdiction—including the standing requirements and Article III—
“are an essential ingredient of separation and equilibration of
powers.” \\Steel Co.\\ v. \\Citizens for Better Environment,\\ 523
U. S. 83, 101 (1998). “Relaxation of standing requirements is
directly related to the expansion of judicial power,” and lowering the
taxpayer standing bar to permit challenges of purely executive actions
“would significantly alter the allocation of power at the national
level, with a shift away from a democratic form of government.”
\\Richardson, supra,\\ at 188 (Powell, J., concurring). The rule
respondents propose would enlist the federal courts to superintend, at
the behest @@612@@ of any federal taxpayer, the speeches, statements,
and myriad daily activities of the President, his staff, and other
Executive Branch officials. This would “be quite at odds with . . .
\\Flast\\’s own promise that it would not transform federal courts
into forums for taxpayers’ ‘generalized grievances’ ” about the
conduct of government, \\Cuno,\\ 547 U. S., at 348 (quoting \\Flast,
supra,\\ at 106), and would “open the Judiciary to an arguable charge
of providing ‘government by injunction,’ ” \\Schlesinger, supra,\\
at 222. It would deputize federal courts as “ ‘virtually continuing
monitors of the wisdom and soundness of Executive action,’ ” and
that, most emphatically, “ ‘is not the role of the judiciary.’ ”
\\Allen,\\ 468 U. S., at 760 (quoting \\Laird\\ v. \\Tatum,\\ 408 U. S.
1, 15 (1972)).

  Both the Court of Appeals and respondents implicitly recognize
that unqualified federal taxpayer standing to assert Establishment
Clause claims would go too far, but neither the Court of Appeals nor
respondents has identified a workable limitation. The Court of Appeals,
as noted, conceded only that a taxpayer would lack standing where “the
marginal or incremental cost to the taxpaying public of the alleged
violation of the establishment clause” is “zero.” 433 F. 3d, at
995. Applying this rule, the Court of Appeals opined that a taxpayer
would not have standing to challenge a President’s favorable reference
to religion in a State of the Union address because the costs associated
with the speech “would be no greater merely because the President had
mentioned Moses rather than John Stuart Mill.” \\Ibid.\\

  There is reason to question whether the Court of Appeals intended
for its zero-marginal-cost test to be taken literally, because the
court, without any apparent inquiry into the costs of Secretary
Paige’s speech, went on to agree that the plaintiffs lacked standing
to challenge that speech. \\Id.,\\ at 996. But if we take the Court
of Appeals’ test literally— \\i. e.,\\ that any marginal cost
greater than zero suffices—tax@@613@@payers might well have standing
to challenge some (and perhaps many) speeches. As Judge Easterbrook
observed: “The total cost of presidential proclamations and speeches
by Cabinet officers that touch on religion (Thanksgiving and several
other holidays) surely exceeds $500,000 annually; it may cost that
much to use Air Force One and send a Secret Service detail to a single
speaking engagement.” 447 F. 3d, at 989–990 (concurring in denial
of rehearing en banc). At a minimum, the Court of Appeals’ approach
(asking whether the marginal cost exceeded zero) would surely create
difficult and uncomfortable line-drawing problems. Suppose that it is
alleged that a speechwriter or other staff member spent extra time doing
research for the purpose of including “religious imagery” in a
speech. Suppose that a President or a Cabinet officer attends or speaks
at a prayer breakfast and that the time spent was time that would have
otherwise been spent on secular work.

  Respondents take a somewhat different approach, contending that
their proposed expansion of \\Flast\\ would be manageable because they
would require that a challenged expenditure be “fairly traceable to
the conduct alleged to violate the Establishment Clause.” Brief for
Respondents 17. Applying this test, they argue, would “scree[n] out . . . 
challenge[s to] the content of one particular speech, for example the
State of the Union address, as an Establishment Clause violation.”
\\Id.,\\ at 21.

  We find little comfort in this vague and ill-defined test. As an
initial matter, respondents fail to explain why the (often substantial)
costs that attend, for example, a Presidential address are any less
“traceable” than the expenses related to the Executive Branch
statements and conferences at issue here. Indeed, respondents concede
that even lawsuits involving \\de minimis\\ amounts of taxpayer money
can pass their proposed “traceability” test. \\Id.,\\ at 20, n. 6.

  Moreover, the “traceability” inquiry, depending on how it is
framed, would appear to prove either too little or too @@614@@ much. If
the question is whether an allegedly unconstitutional executive action
can somehow be traced to taxpayer funds \\in general,\\ the answer will
always be yes: Almost all Executive Branch activities are ultimately
funded by \\some\\ congressional appropriation, whether general or
specific, which is in turn financed by tax receipts. If, on the other
hand, the question is whether the challenged action can be traced to
the contributions of a \\particular\\ taxpayer-plaintiff, the answer
will almost always be no: As we recognized in \\Frothingham,\\ the
interest of any individual taxpayer in a particular federal expenditure
“is comparatively minute and indeterminable . . . and constantly
changing.” 262 U. S., at 487.

## B

  Respondents set out a parade of horribles that they claim could
occur if \\Flast\\ is not extended to discretionary Executive Branch
expenditures. For example, they say, a federal agency could use its
discretionary funds to build a house of worship or to hire clergy of one
denomination and send them out to spread their faith. Or an agency could
use its funds to make bulk purchases of Stars of David, crucifixes,
or depictions of the star and crescent for use in its offices or for
distribution to the employees or the general public. Of course, none of
these things has happened, even though \\Flast\\ has not previously been
expanded in the way that respondents urge. In the unlikely event that
any of these executive actions did take place, Congress could quickly
step in. And respondents make no effort to show that these improbable
abuses could not be challenged in federal court by plaintiffs who would
possess standing based on grounds other than taxpayer standing.

## C

  Over the years, \\Flast\\ has been defended by some and criticized
by others. But the present case does not require us to reconsider that
precedent. The Court of Appeals did not @@615@@ apply \\Flast;\\ it
extended \\Flast.\\ It is a necessary concomitant of the doctrine of
\\stare decisis\\ that a precedent is not always expanded to the limit
of its logic. That was the approach that then-Justice Rehnquist took in
his opinion for the Court in \\Valley Forge,\\ and it is the approach we
take here. We do not extend \\Flast,\\ but we also do not overrule it.
We leave \\Flast\\ as we found it.

  <<Justice Scalia>> says that we must either overrule \\Flast\\
or extend it to the limits of its logic. His position is not
“[in]sane,” inconsistent with the “rule of law,” or “utterly
meaningless.” \\Post,\\ at 618 (opinion concurring in judgment). But
it is wrong. <<Justice Scalia>> does not seriously dispute either (1)
that \\Flast\\ itself spoke in terms of “legislative enactment[s]”
and “exercises of congressional power,” 392 U. S., at 102, or (2)
that in the four decades since \\Flast\\ was decided, we have never
extended its narrow exception to a purely discretionary Executive Branch
expenditure. We need go no further to decide this case. Relying on the
provision of the Constitution that limits our role to resolving the
“Cases” and “Controversies” before us, we decide only the case
at hand.

  For these reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the
Seventh Circuit is reversed.

        \\It is so ordered.\\
