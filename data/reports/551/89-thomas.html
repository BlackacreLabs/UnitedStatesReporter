<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Justice Thomas,</span> dissenting.</p>

<p>I have repeatedly stated that the Eighth Amendment’s prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment historically concerned only injuries relating to a criminal sentence. <em>Farmer</em> v. <em>Brennan,</em> 511 U.&nbsp;S. 825, 861 (1994) (opinion concurring in judgment); <em>Helling</em> v. <em>McKinney,</em> 509 U.&nbsp;S. 25, 42 (1993) (dissenting opinion); <em>Hudson</em> v. <em>McMillian,</em> 503 U.&nbsp;S. 1, 18–20 (1992) (same). But even applying the Court’s flawed Eighth Amendment jurisprudence, “I would draw the line at actual, serious injuries and reject the claim that exposure to the <em>risk</em> of injury can violate the Eighth Amendment.” <em>Helling, supra,</em> at 42 (<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Thomas,</span> J., dissenting). Consistent with these views, I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals. I respectfully dissent.</p>
