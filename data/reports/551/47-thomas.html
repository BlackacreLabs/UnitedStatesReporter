<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Justice Thomas,</span> with whom <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Justice Alito</span> joins, concurring in part. </p>

<p>I agree with the Court’s disposition and most of its reasoning. Safeco did not send notices to new customers because it took the position that the initial insurance rate it offered a customer could not be an “increase in any charge for&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. insurance” under 15 U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §&nbsp;1681a(k)(1)(B)(i). The Court properly holds that regardless of the merits of this interpretation, it is not an unreasonable one, and Safeco therefore did not act willfully. <em>Ante,</em> at 68–70. I do not join Part III–A of the Court’s opinion, however, because it resolves the merits of Safeco’s interpretation of §&nbsp;1681a(k)(1)(B)(i)— an issue not necessary to the Court’s conclusion and not briefed or argued by the parties.</p>
