  These cases consider the longstanding efforts of two local school
boards to integrate their public schools. The school board plans before
us resemble many others adopted in the last 50 years by primary and
secondary schools throughout the Nation. All of those plans represent
local efforts to bring about the kind of racially integrated education
that \\Brown\\ v. \\Board of Education,\\ 347 U. S. 483 (1954),
long ago promised—efforts that this Court has repeatedly required,
permitted, and encouraged local authorities to undertake. This Court
has recognized that the public interests at stake in such cases are
“compelling.” We have approved of “narrowly tailored” plans
that are no less race conscious than the plans before us. And we have
understood that the Constitution \\permits\\ local communities to adopt
desegregation plans even where it does not \\require\\ them to do so.

  The plurality pays inadequate attention to this law, to past
opinions’ rationales, their language, and the contexts in which
they arise. As a result, it reverses course and reaches the wrong
conclusion. In doing so, it distorts precedent, it misapplies the
relevant constitutional principles, it announces legal rules that will
obstruct efforts by state and local governments to deal effectively with
the growing resegregation of public schools, it threatens to substitute
for present calm a disruptive round of race-related litigation, and it
undermines \\Brown\\’s promise of integrated primary and secondary
education that local communities have sought @@804@@ to make a reality.
This cannot be justified in the name of the Equal Protection Clause.

# I \\Facts\\

  The historical and factual context in which these cases arise is
critical. In \\Brown,\\ this Court held that the government’s
segregation of schoolchildren by race violates the Constitution’s
promise of equal protection. The Court emphasized that “education is
perhaps the most important function of state and local governments.”
347 U. S., at 493. And it thereby set the Nation on a path toward public
school integration.

  In dozens of subsequent cases, this Court told school districts
previously segregated by law what they must do at a minimum to comply
with \\Brown\\’s constitutional holding. The measures required by
those cases often included raceconscious practices, such as mandatory
busing and racebased restrictions on voluntary transfers. See, \\e. g.,
Columbus Bd. of Ed.\\ v. \\Penick,\\ 443 U. S. 449, 455, n. 3 (1979);
\\Davis\\ v. \\Board of School Comm’rs of Mobile Cty.,\\ 402 U. S.
33, 37–38 (1971); \\Green\\ v. \\School Bd. of New Kent Cty.,\\ 391
U. S. 430, 441–442 (1968).

  Beyond those minimum requirements, the Court left much of the
determination of how to achieve integration to the judgment of local
communities. Thus, in respect to raceconscious desegregation measures
that the Constitution \\permitted,\\ but did not \\require\\ (measures
similar to those at issue here), this Court unanimously stated:

      “School authorities are traditionally charged with broad
power to formulate and implement educational policy and might well
conclude, for example, that in order to prepare students to live in
a pluralistic society each school should have a prescribed ratio of
Negro to white students reflecting the proportion for the district as a
whole. \\To do this as an educational policy is within\\ @@805@@ \\the
broad discretionary powers of school authorities.\\” \\Swann\\ v.
\\Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Ed.,\\ 402 U. S. 1, 16 (1971) (emphasis
added).

  As a result, different districts—some acting under court decree,
some acting in order to avoid threatened lawsuits, some seeking
to comply with federal administrative orders, some acting purely
voluntarily, some acting after federal courts had dissolved earlier
orders—adopted, modified, and experimented with hosts of different
kinds of plans, including race-conscious plans, all with a similar
objective: greater racial integration of public schools. See F. Welch &
A. Light, New Evidence on School Desegregation, p. v (1987) (hereinafter
Welch) (prepared for the Commission on Civil Rights) (reviewing a sample
of 125 school districts, constituting 20% of national public school
enrollment, that had experimented with nearly 300 different plans over
18 years). The techniques that different districts have employed range
“from voluntary transfer programs to mandatory reassignment.”
\\Id.,\\ at 21. And the design of particular plans has been “dictated
by both the law and the specific needs of the district.” \\Ibid.\\

  Overall these efforts brought about considerable racial integration.
More recently, however, progress has stalled. Between 1968 and 1980,
the number of black children attending a school where minority children
constituted more than half of the school fell from 77% to 63% in the
Nation (from 81% to 57% in the South) but then reversed direction by the
year 2000, rising from 63% to 72% in the Nation (from 57% to 69% in the
South). Similarly, between 1968 and 1980, the number of black children
attending schools that were more than 90% minority fell from 64% to 33%
in the Nation (from 78% to 23% in the South), but that too reversed
direction, rising by the year 2000 from 33% to 37% in the Nation (from
23% to 31% in the South). As of 2002, almost 2.4 million students, or
over 5% of all public school enrollment, attended schools with a white
population of less than 1%. Of these, @@806@@ 2.3 million were black and
Latino students, and only 72,000 were white. Today, more than one in six
black children attend a school that is 99%–100% minority. See Appendix
A, \\infra.\\ In light of the evident risk of a return to school systems
that are in fact (though not in law) resegregated, many school districts
have felt a need to maintain or to extend their integration efforts.

  The upshot is that myriad school districts operating in myriad
circumstances have devised myriad plans, often with race-conscious
elements, all for the sake of eradicating earlier school segregation,
bringing about integration, or preventing retrogression. Seattle and
Louisville are two such districts, and the histories of their present
plans set forth typical school integration stories.

  I describe those histories at length in order to highlight three
important features of these cases. First, the school districts’ plans
serve “compelling interests” and are “narrowly tailored” on any
reasonable definition of those terms. Second, the distinction between
\\de jure\\ segregation (caused by school systems) and \\de facto\\
segregation (caused, \\e. g.,\\ by housing patterns or generalized
societal discrimination) is meaningless in the present context, thereby
dooming the plurality’s endeavor to find support for its views in that
distinction. Third, real-world efforts to substitute racially diverse
for racially segregated schools (however caused) are complex, to the
point where the Constitution cannot plausibly be interpreted to rule out
categorically all local efforts to use means that are “conscious” of
the race of individuals.

  In both Seattle and Louisville, the local school districts began
with schools that were highly segregated in fact. In both cities,
plaintiffs filed lawsuits claiming unconstitutional segregation. In
Louisville, a Federal District Court found that school segregation
reflected pre-\\Brown\\ state laws separating the races. In Seattle,
the plaintiffs alleged that school segregation unconstitutionally
reflected not only generalized societal discrimination and residential
housing pat@@807@@terns, but also \\school board policies and actions\\
that had helped to create, maintain, and aggravate racial segregation.
In Louisville, a federal court entered a remedial decree. In Seattle,
the parties settled after the school district pledged to undertake a
desegregation plan. In both cities, the school boards adopted plans
designed to achieve integration by bringing about more racially diverse
schools. In each city, the school board modified its plan several
times in light of, for example, hostility to busing, the threat of
resegregation, and the desirability of introducing greater student
choice. And in each city, the school boards’ plans have evolved
over time in ways that progressively \\diminish\\ the plans’ use of
explicit race-conscious criteria.

  The histories that follow set forth these basic facts. They are based
upon numerous sources, which for ease of exposition I have cataloged,
along with their corresponding citations, at Appendix B, \\infra.\\

## A \\Seattle\\

  \\1. Segregation, 1945 to 1956.\\ During and just after World War
II, significant numbers of black Americans began to make Seattle their
home. Few black residents lived outside the central section of the city.
Most worked at unskilled jobs. Although black students made up about
3% of the total Seattle population in the mid-1950’s, nearly all
black children attended schools where a majority of the population was
minority. Elementary schools in central Seattle were between 60% and
80% black; Garfield, the central district high school, was more than
50% minority; schools outside the central and southeastern sections of
Seattle were virtually all white.

  \\2. Preliminary Challenges, 1956 to 1969.\\ In 1956, a memo for
the Seattle School Board reported that school segregation reflected
not only segregated housing patterns but also school board policies
that permitted white students to @@808@@ transfer out of black schools
while restricting the transfer of black students into white schools. In
1958, black parents whose children attended Harrison Elementary School
(with a black student population of over 75%) wrote the Seattle board,
complaining that the “ ‘boundaries for the Harrison Elementary
School were not set in accordance with the long-established standards
of the School District . . . but were arbitrarily set with an end to
excluding colored children from McGilvra School, which is adjacent to
the Harrison school district.’ ”

  In 1963, at the insistence of the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and other community groups, the
school board adopted a new racebased transfer policy. The new policy
added an explicitly racial criterion: If a place exists in a school,
then, irrespective of other transfer criteria, a white student may
transfer to a predominantly black school, and a black student may
transfer to a predominantly white school.

  At that time, one high school, Garfield, was about two-thirds
minority; eight high schools were virtually all white. In 1963, the
transfer program’s first year, 239 black students and 8 white students
transferred. In 1969, about 2,200 (of 10,383 total) of the district’s
black students and about 400 of the district’s white students took
advantage of the plan. For the next decade, annual program transfers
remained at approximately this level.

  \\3. The NAACP’s First Legal Challenge and Seattle’s Response,
1966 to 1977.\\ In 1966, the NAACP filed a federal lawsuit against
the school board, claiming that the board had “unlawfully and
unconstitutionally” “establish[ed]” and “maintain[ed]” a
system of “racially segregated public schools.” The complaint said
that 77% of black public elementary school students in Seattle attended
9 of the city’s 86 elementary schools and that 23 of the remaining
schools had no black students at all. Similarly, of the 1,461 black
stu@@809@@dents enrolled in the 12 senior high schools in Seattle, 1,151
(or 78.8%) attended 3 senior high schools, and 900 (61.6%) attended a
single school, Garfield.

  The complaint charged that the school board had brought about this
segregated system in part by “mak[ing] and enforc[ing]” certain
“rules and regulations,” in part by “drawing . . . boundary lines”
and “executing school attendance policies” that would create and
maintain “predominantly Negro or non-white schools,” and in part by
building schools “in such a manner as to restrict the Negro plaintiffs
and the class they represent to predominantly Negro or non-white
schools.” The complaint also charged that the board discriminated in
assigning teachers.

  The board responded to the lawsuit by introducing a plan that required
race-based transfers and mandatory busing. The plan created three new
middle schools at three school buildings in the predominantly white
north end. It then created a “mixed” student body by assigning
to those schools students who would otherwise attend predominantly
white, or predominantly black, schools elsewhere. It used explicitly
racial criteria in making these assignments (\\i. e.,\\ it deliberately
assigned to the new middle schools black students, not white students,
from the black schools and white students, not black students, from
the white schools). And it used busing to transport the students to
their new assignments. The plan provoked considerable local opposition.
Opponents brought a lawsuit. But eventually a state court found that the
mandatory busing was lawful.

  In 1976–1977, the plan involved the busing of about 500 middle
school students (300 black students and 200 white students). Another
1,200 black students and 400 white students participated in the
previously adopted voluntary transfer program. Thus about 2,000
students out of a total district population of about 60,000 students
were involved in one or the other transfer program. At that time, about
@@810@@ 20% or 12,000 of the district’s students were black. And the
board continued to describe 26 of its 112 schools as “segregated.”

  \\4. The NAACP’s Second Legal Challenge, 1977.\\ In 1977, the NAACP
filed another legal complaint, this time with the federal Department
of Health, Education, and Welfare’s Office for Civil Rights (OCR).
The complaint alleged that the Seattle School Board had created or
perpetuated unlawful racial segregation through, \\e. g.,\\ certain
school-transfer criteria, a construction program that needlessly
built new schools in white areas, district line-drawing criteria, the
maintenance of inferior facilities at black schools, the use of explicit
racial criteria in the assignment of teachers and other staff, and a
general pattern of delay in respect to the implementation of promised
desegregation efforts.

  The OCR and the school board entered into a formal settlement
agreement. The agreement required the board to implement what became
known as the “Seattle Plan.”

  \\5. The Seattle Plan: Mandatory Busing, 1978 to 1988.\\ The board
began to implement the Seattle Plan in 1978. This plan labeled
“racially imbalanced” any school at which the percentage of black
students exceeded by more than 20% the minority population of the school
district as a whole. It applied that label to 26 schools, including 4
high schools— Cleveland (72.8% minority), Franklin (76.6% minority),
Garfield (78.4% minority), and Rainier Beach (58.9% minority). The
plan paired (or “triaded”) “imbalanced” black schools with
“imbalanced” white schools. It then placed some grades (say, third
and fourth grades) at one school building and other grades (say, fifth
and sixth grades) at the other school building. And it thereby required,
for example, all fourth grade students from the previously black and
previously white schools first to attend together what would now be a
“mixed” fourth grade at one of the school buildings and then the
next year to attend what would now be a “mixed” fifth grade at the
other school building. @@811@@

  At the same time, the plan provided that a previous “black” school
would remain about 50% black, while a previous “white” school would
remain about two-thirds white. It was consequently necessary to decide
with some care \\which\\ students would attend the new “mixed”
grade. For this purpose, administrators cataloged the racial makeup of
each neighborhood housing block. The school district met its percentage
goals by assigning to the new “mixed” school an appropriate number
of “black” housing blocks and “white” housing blocks. At the
same time, transport from house to school involved extensive busing,
with about half of all students attending a school other than the one
closest to their home.

  The Seattle Plan achieved the school integration that it sought. Just
prior to the plan’s implementation, for example, 4 of Seattle’s
11 high schools were “imbalanced,” \\i. e.,\\ almost exclusively
“black” or almost exclusively “white.” By 1979, only two
were out of “balance.” By 1980, only Cleveland remained out of
“balance” (as the board defined it) and that by a mere two students.

  Nonetheless, the Seattle Plan, due to its busing, provoked serious
opposition within the State. See generally \\Washington\\ v. \\Seattle
School Dist. No. 1,\\ 458 U. S. 457, 461–466 (1982). Thus, Washington
state voters enacted an initiative that amended state law to require
students to be assigned to the schools closest to their homes. \\Id.,\\
at 462. The Seattle School Board challenged the constitutionality
of the initiative. \\Id.,\\ at 464. This Court then held that the
initiative— which would have prevented the Seattle Plan from taking
effect—violated the Fourteenth Amendment. \\Id.,\\ at 470.

  \\6. Student Choice, 1988 to 1998.\\ By 1988, many white families had
left the school district, and many Asian families had moved in. The
public school population had fallen from about 100,000 to less than
50,000. The racial makeup of the school population amounted to 43%
white, 24% black, and 23% Asian or Pacific Islander, with Hispanics and
Native @@812@@ Americans making up the rest. The cost of busing, the
harm that members of all racial communities feared that the Seattle Plan
caused, the desire to attract white families back to the public schools,
and the interest in providing greater school choice led the board to
abandon busing and to substitute a new student assignment policy that
resembles the plan now before us.

  The new plan permitted each student to choose the school he or she
wished to attend, subject to race-based constraints. In respect to high
schools, for example, a student was given a list of a subset of schools,
carefully selected by the board to balance racial distribution in the
district by including neighborhood schools and schools in racially
different neighborhoods elsewhere in the city. The student could then
choose among those schools, indicating a first choice, and other choices
the student found acceptable. In making an assignment to a particular
high school, the district would give first preference to a student with
a sibling already at the school. It gave second preference to a student
whose race differed from a race that was “over-represented” at
the school (\\i. e.,\\ a race that accounted for a higher percentage
of the school population than of the total district population). It
gave third preference to students residing in the neighborhood. It
gave fourth preference to students who received child care in the
neighborhood. In a typical year, say, 1995, about 20,000 potential high
school students participated. About 68% received their first choice.
Another 16% received an “acceptable” choice. A further 16% were
assigned to a school they had not listed.

  \\7. The Current Plan, 1999 to the Present.\\ In 1996, the school
board adopted the present plan, which began in 1999. In doing so, it
sought to deemphasize the use of racial criteria and to increase the
likelihood that a student would receive an assignment at his first or
second choice high school. The district retained a racial tiebreaker
for oversubscribed schools, which takes effect only if the school’s
minority or @@813@@ majority enrollment falls outside of a 30% range
centered on the minority/majority population ratio within the district.
At the same time, all students were free subsequently to transfer from
the school at which they were initially placed to a different school of
their choice without regard to race. Thus, at worst, a student would
have to spend one year at a high school he did not pick as a first or
second choice.

  The new plan worked roughly as expected for the two school years
during which it was in effect (1999–2000 and 2000–2001). In the
2000–2001 school year, for example, with the racial tiebreaker, the
entering ninth grade class at Franklin High School had a 60% minority
population; without the racial tiebreaker that same class at Franklin
would have had an almost 80% minority population. (We consider only the
ninth grade since only students entering that class were subject to
the tiebreaker, and because the plan was not in place long enough to
change the composition of an entire school.) In the year 2005–2006, by
which time the racial tiebreaker had not been used for several years,
Franklin’s overall minority enrollment had risen to 90%. During the
period the tiebreaker applied, it typically affected about 300 students
per year. Between 80% and 90% of all students received their first
choice assignment; between 89% and 97% received their first or second
choice assignment.

  Petitioner Parents Involved in Community Schools objected to
Seattle’s most recent plan under the State and Federal Constitutions.
In due course, the Washington Supreme Court, the Federal District
Court, and the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (sitting en banc)
rejected the challenge and found Seattle’s plan lawful.

## B \\Louisville\\

  \\1. Before the Lawsuit, 1954 to 1972.\\ In 1956, two years after
\\Brown\\ made clear that Kentucky could no longer require racial
segregation by law, the Louisville Board of Edu@@814@@cation created
a geography-based student assignment plan designed to help achieve
school integration. At the same time, it adopted an open transfer policy
under which approximately 3,000 of Louisville’s 46,000 students
applied for transfer. By 1972, however, the Louisville School District
remained highly segregated. Approximately half the district’s public
school enrollment was black; about half was white. Fourteen of the
district’s nineteen nonvocational middle and high schools were
close to totally black or totally white. Nineteen of the district’s
forty-six elementary schools were between 80% and 100% black. Twenty-one
elementary schools were between roughly 90% and 100% white.

  \\2. Court-Imposed Guidelines and Busing, 1972 to 1991.\\ In 1972,
civil rights groups and parents, claiming unconstitutional segregation,
sued the Louisville Board of Education in federal court. The original
litigation eventually became a lawsuit against the Jefferson County
School System, which in April 1975 absorbed Louisville’s schools
and combined them with those of the surrounding suburbs. (For ease of
exposition, I shall still use “Louisville” to refer to what is now
the combined districts.) After preliminary rulings and an eventual
victory for the plaintiffs in the Court of Appeals for the Sixth
Circuit, the District Court in July 1975 entered an order requiring
desegregation.

  The order’s requirements reflected a (newly enlarged) school
district student population of about 135,000, approximately 20% of
whom were black. The order required the school board to create and to
maintain schools with student populations that ranged, for elementary
schools, between 12% and 40% black, and for secondary schools (with one
exception), between 12.5% and 35% black.

  The District Court also adopted a complex desegregation plan designed
to achieve the order’s targets. The plan required redrawing school
attendance zones, closing 12 schools, and busing groups of students,
selected by race and the first letter of their last names, to schools
outside their immediate @@815@@ neighborhoods. The plan’s initial
busing requirements were extensive, involving the busing of 23,000
students and a transportation fleet that had to “operate from early
in the morning until late in the evening.” For typical students, the
plan meant busing for several years (several more years for typical
black students than for typical white students). The following notice,
published in a Louisville newspaper in 1976, gives a sense of how the
district’s race-based busing plan operated in practice: Louisville
Courier-Journal, June 18, 1976 (reproduced in J. Wilkinson, From
\\Brown\\ to \\Bakke:\\ The Supreme Court and School Integration
1954–1978, p. 176 (1979)).

  The District Court monitored implementation of the plan. In 1978, it
found that the plan had brought all of Louisville’s schools within
its “ ‘guidelines’ for racial composition” for “at least a
substantial portion of the [previous] three years.” It removed the
case from its active docket while stating that it expected the board
“to continue to implement those portions of the desegregation order
which are by their nature of a continuing effect.” @@816@@

  By 1984, after several schools had fallen out of compliance with
the order’s racial percentages due to shifting demographics in
the community, the school board revised its desegregation plan. In
doing so, the board created a new racial “guideline,” namely a
“floating range of 10% above and 10% below the countywide average
for the different grade levels.” The board simultaneously redrew
district boundaries so that middle school students could attend the
same school for three years and high school students for four years.
It added “magnet” programs at two high schools. And it adjusted
its alphabet-based system for grouping and busing students. The board
estimated that its new plan would lead to annual reassignment (with
busing) of about 8,500 black students and about 8,000 white students.

  \\3. Student Choice and Project Renaissance, 1991 to 1996.\\ By 1991,
the board had concluded that assigning elementary school students to
two or more schools during their elementary school years had proved
educationally unsound and, if continued, would undermine Kentucky’s
newly adopted Education Reform Act. It consequently conducted a
nearly year-long review of its plan. In doing so, it consulted widely
with parents and other members of the local community, using public
presentations, public meetings, and various other methods to obtain the
public’s input. At the conclusion of this review, the board adopted
a new plan, called “Project Renaissance,” that emphasized student
choice.

  Project Renaissance again revised the board’s racial guidelines.
It provided that each elementary school would have a black student
population of between 15% and 50%; each middle and high school would
have a black population and a white population that fell within a range,
the boundaries of which were set at 15% above and 15% below the general
student population percentages in the county at that grade level.
The plan then drew new geographical school assignment zones designed
to satisfy these guidelines; the district could reassign students
if particular schools failed to meet @@817@@ the guidelines and was
required to do so if a school repeatedly missed these targets.

  In respect to elementary schools, the plan first drew a neighborhood
line around each elementary school, and it then drew a second line
around groups of elementary schools (called “clusters”). It
initially assigned each student to his or her neighborhood school,
but it permitted each student freely to transfer between elementary
schools within each cluster \\provided that\\ the transferring student
(1) was black if transferring from a predominantly black school to a
predominantly white school, or (2) was white if transferring from a
predominantly white school to a predominantly black school. Students
could also apply to attend magnet elementary schools or programs.

  The plan required each middle school student to be assigned to his or
her neighborhood school unless the student applied for, and was accepted
by, a magnet middle school. The plan provided for “open” high school
enrollment. Every 9th or 10th grader could apply to any high school in
the system, and the high school would accept applicants according to
set criteria—one of which consisted of the need to attain or remain
in compliance with the plan’s racial guidelines. Finally, the plan
created two new magnet schools, one each at the elementary and middle
school levels.

  \\4. The Current Plan: Project Renaissance Modified, 1996to 2003.\\
In 1995 and 1996, the Louisville School Board, with the help of a
special “Planning Team,” community meetings, and other official and
unofficial study groups, monitored the effects of Project Renaissance
and considered proposals for improvement. Consequently, in 1996, the
board modified Project Renaissance, thereby creating the present plan.

  At the time, the district’s public school population was
approximately 30% black. The plan consequently redrew the racial
“guidelines,” setting the boundaries at 15% to 50% black for \\all\\
schools. It again redrew school assignment boundaries. And it expanded
the transfer opportunities @@818@@ available to elementary and middle
school pupils. The plan forbade transfers, however, if the transfer
would lead to a school population outside the guidelines range, \\i.
e.,\\ if it would create a school where fewer than 15% or more than 50%
of the students were black.

  The plan also established “Parent Assistance Centers” to help
parents and students navigate the school selection and assignment
process. It pledged the use of other resources in order to “encourage
all schools to achieve an African- American enrollment equivalent to
the average district-wide African-American enrollment at the school’s
respective elementary, middle or high school level.” And the plan
continued use of magnet schools.

  In 1999, several parents brought a lawsuit in federal court attacking
the plan’s use of racial guidelines at one of the district’s
magnet schools. They asked the court to dissolve the desegregation
order and to hold the use of \\magnet\\ school racial guidelines
unconstitutional. The board opposed dissolution, arguing that “the
old dual system” had left a “demographic imbalance” that
“prevent[ed] dissolution.” In 2000, after reviewing the present
plan, the District Court dissolved the 1975 order. It wrote that there
was “overwhelming evidence of the Board’s good faith compliance with
the desegregation Decree and its underlying purposes.” It added that
the Louisville School Board had “treated the ideal of an integrated
system as much more than a legal obligation—they consider it a
positive, desirable policy and an essential element of any well-rounded
public school education.”

  The court also found that the magnet programs available at the high
school in question were “not available at other high schools” in
the school district. It consequently held unconstitutional the use of
race-based “targets” to govern admission to \\magnet schools.\\ And
it ordered the board not to control access to those scarce programs
through the use of racial targets. @@819@@

  \\5. The Current Lawsuit, 2003 to the Present.\\ Subsequent to the
District Court’s dissolution of the desegregation order (in 2000) the
board simply continued to implement its 1996 plan as modified to reflect
the court’s magnet school determination. In 2003, the petitioner
now before us, Crystal Meredith, brought this lawsuit challenging the
plan’s unmodified portions, \\i. e.,\\ those portions that dealt with
\\ordinary,\\ not magnet, schools. Both the District Court and the Court
of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit rejected Meredith’s challenge and
held the unmodified aspects of the plan constitutional.

## C

  The histories I have set forth describe the extensive and ongoing
efforts of two school districts to bring about greater racial
integration of their public schools. In both cases the efforts were in
part remedial. Louisville began its integration efforts in earnest when
a federal court in 1975 entered a school desegregation order. Seattle
undertook its integration efforts in response to the filing of a federal
lawsuit and as a result of its settlement of a segregation complaint
filed with the federal OCR.

  The plans in both Louisville and Seattle grow out of these earlier
remedial efforts. Both districts faced problems that reflected initial
periods of severe racial segregation, followed by such remedial efforts
as busing, followed by evidence of resegregation, followed by a need to
end busing and encourage the return of, \\e. g.,\\ suburban students
through increased student choice. When formulating the plans under
review, both districts drew upon their considerable experience with
earlier plans, having revised their policies periodically in light of
that experience. Both districts rethought their methods over time and
explored a wide range of other means, including non-race-conscious
policies. Both districts also considered elaborate studies and consulted
widely within their communities. @@820@@

  Both districts sought greater racial integration for educational and
democratic, as well as for remedial, reasons. Both sought to achieve
these objectives while preserving their commitment to other educational
goals, \\e. g.,\\ district-wide commitment to high quality public
schools, increased pupil assignment to neighborhood schools, diminished
use of busing, greater student choice, reduced risk of white flight,
and so forth. Consequently, the present plans expand student choice;
they limit the burdens (including busing) that earlier plans had
imposed upon students and their families; and they use race-conscious
criteria in limited and gradually diminishing ways. In particular, they
use race-conscious criteria only to mark the outer bounds of broad
population-related ranges.

  The histories also make clear the futility of looking simply to
whether earlier school segregation was \\de jure\\ or \\de facto\\ in
order to draw firm lines separating the constitutionally permissible
from the constitutionally forbidden use of “race-conscious”
criteria. <<Justice Thomas>> suggests that it will be easy to identify
\\de jure\\ segregation because “[i]n most cases, there either will
or will not have been a state constitutional amendment, state statute,
local ordinance, or local administrative policy explicitly requiring
separation of the races.” \\Ante,\\ at 752, n. 4 (concurring opinion).
But our precedent has recognized that \\de jure\\ discrimination can be
present even in the absence of racially explicit laws. See \\Yick Wo\\
v. \\Hopkins,\\ 118 U. S. 356, 373–374 (1886).

  No one here disputes that Louisville’s segregation was \\dejure.\\
But what about Seattle’s? Was it \\de facto? Dejure?\\ A mixture?
Opinions differed. Or is it that a prior federal court had not
adjudicated the matter? Does that make a difference? Is Seattle free on
remand to say that its schools were \\de jure\\ segregated, just as in
1956 a memo for the school board admitted? The plurality does not seem
confident as to the answer. Compare \\ante,\\ at 720 (opinion of the
Court) (“[T]he Seattle public schools \\have not shown\\ @@821@@ that
they were ever segregated by law” (emphasis added)), with \\ante,\\
at 737 (plurality opinion) (assuming “the Seattle school district
was never segregated by law,” but seeming to concede that a school
district with \\de jure\\ segregation need not be subject to a court
order to be allowed to engage in race-based remedial measures).

  A court finding of \\de jure\\ segregation cannot be the crucial
variable. After all, a number of school districts in the South
that the Government or private plaintiffs challenged as segregated
\\by law\\ voluntarily desegregated their schools \\without a
court order\\—just as Seattle did. See, \\e. g.,\\ Coleman,

  Moreover, Louisville’s history makes clear that a community under a
court order to desegregate might submit a race-conscious remedial plan
\\before\\ the court dissolved the order, but with every intention of
following that plan even \\after\\ dissolution. How could such a plan be
lawful the day before dissolution but then become unlawful the very next
day? On what legal ground can the majority rest its contrary view? But
see \\ante,\\ at 720–721, 725, n. 12. @@822@@

  Are courts really to treat as merely \\de facto\\ segregated those
school districts that avoided a federal order by voluntarily complying
with \\Brown\\’s requirements? See \\ante,\\ at 720 (opinion of the
Court), \\ante,\\ at 736 (plurality opinion). This Court has previously
done just the opposite, permitting a race-conscious remedy without
any kind of court decree. See \\McDaniel, supra,\\ at 41. Because the
Constitution emphatically does not forbid the use of race-conscious
measures by districts in the South that voluntarily desegregated their
schools, on what basis does the plurality claim that the law forbids
Seattle to do the same? But see \\ante,\\ at 737.

  The histories also indicate the complexity of the tasks and the
practical difficulties that local school boards face when they seek to
achieve greater racial integration. The boards work in communities where
demographic patterns change, where they must meet traditional learning
goals, where they must attract and retain effective teachers, where
they should (and will) take account of parents’ views and maintain
\\their\\ commitment to public school education, where they must adapt
to court intervention, where they must encourage voluntary student and
parent action—where they will find that their own good faith, their
knowledge, and their understanding of local circumstances are always
necessary but often insufficient to solve the problems at hand.

  These facts and circumstances help explain why in this context, as to
means, the law often leaves legislatures, city councils, school boards,
and voters with a broad range of choice, thereby giving “different
communities” the opportunity to “try different solutions to common
problems and gravitate toward those that prove most successful or
seem to them best to suit their individual needs.” \\Comfort\\ v.

  With this factual background in mind, I turn to the legal question:
Does the United States Constitution prohibit these school boards from
using race-conscious criteria in the limited ways at issue here?

# II \\The Legal Standard\\

  A longstanding and unbroken line of legal authority tells us that
the Equal Protection Clause permits local school boards to use
race-conscious criteria to achieve positive race-related goals, even
when the Constitution does not compel it. Because of its importance, I
shall repeat what this Court said about the matter in \\Swann.\\ Chief
Justice Burger, on behalf of a unanimous Court in a case of exceptional
importance, wrote:

      “School authorities are traditionally charged with broad power
to formulate and implement educational policy and might well conclude,
for example, that in order to prepare students to live in a pluralistic
society each school should have a prescribed ratio of Negro to white
students reflecting the proportion for the district as a whole. To do
this as an educational policy is within the broad discretionary powers
of school authorities.” 402 U. S., at 16.

The statement was not a technical holding in the case. But the Court
set forth in \\Swann\\ a basic principle of constitutional law—a
principle of law that has found “wide acceptance in the legal
culture.” \\Dickerson\\ v. \\United States,\\ 530 U. S. 428, 443
(2000) (internal quotation marks omitted); \\Mitchell\\ v. \\United
States,\\ 526 U. S. 314, 330 (1999); \\id.,\\ at 331, 332 (<<Scalia,>>
J., dissenting) (citing “ ‘wide acceptance in the legal culture’
” as “adequate reason not to overrule” prior cases).

  Thus, in \\North Carolina Bd. of Ed.\\ v. \\Swann,\\ 402 U. S.
43, 45 (1971), this Court, citing \\Swann,\\ restated the point.
“[S]chool authorities,” the Court said, “have wide discretion
@@824@@ in formulating school policy, and . . . asa matter of educational
policy school authorities may well conclude that some kind of
racial balance in the schools is desirable quite apart from any
constitutional requirements.” Then-Justice Rehnquist echoed this view
in \\Bustop, Inc.\\ v. \\Los Angeles Bd. ofEd.,\\ 439 U. S. 1380,
1383 (1978) (opinion in chambers), making clear that he too believed
that \\Swann\\’s statement reflected settled law: “While I have
the gravest doubts that [a state supreme court] was \\required\\ by
the United States Constitution to take the [desegregation] action
that it has taken in this case, I have very little doubt that it was
\\permitted\\ by that Constitution to take such action.” (Emphasis in
original.)

  These statements nowhere suggest that this freedom is limited to
school districts where court-ordered desegregation measures are also
in effect. Indeed, in \\McDaniel,\\ a case decided the same day as
\\Swann,\\ a group of parents challenged a race-conscious student
assignment plan that the Clarke County School Board had \\voluntarily\\
adopted as a remedy without a court order (though under federal agency
pressure—pressure Seattle also encountered). The plan required that
each elementary school in the district maintain 20% to 40% enrollment
of African-American students, corresponding to the racial composition
of the district. See \\Barresi\\ v. \\Browne,\\ 226 Ga. 456, 456–459,
175 S. E. 2d 649, 650– 651 (1970). This Court upheld the plan, see
\\McDaniel,\\ 402 U. S., at 41, rejecting the parents’ argument that
“a person may not be \\included\\ or \\excluded\\ solely because
he is a Negro or because he is white,” Brief for Respondents in
\\McDaniel,\\ O. T. 1970, No. 420, p. 25.

  Federal authorities had claimed—as the NAACP and the OCR did in
Seattle—that Clarke County schools were segregated in law, not just in
fact. The plurality’s claim that Seattle was “never segregated by
law” is simply not accurate. Compare \\ante,\\ at 737, with \\supra,\\
at 807–810. The plurality could validly claim that \\no court\\ ever
found that Seattle @@825@@ schools were segregated in law. But that
is also true of the Clarke County schools in \\McDaniel.\\ Unless we
believe that the Constitution enforces one legal standard for the
South and another for the North, this Court should grant Seattle the
permission it granted Clarke County, Georgia. See \\Mc-Daniel, supra,\\
at 41 (“[S]teps will almost invariably require that students be
assigned ‘differently because of their race.’ . . . Any other
approach would freeze the status quo that is the very target of all
desegregation processes”).

  This Court has also held that school districts may be required by
federal statute to undertake race-conscious desegregation efforts even
when there is no likelihood that \\de jure\\ segregation can be shown.
In \\Board of Ed. of City SchoolDist. of New York\\ v. \\Harris,\\
444 U. S. 130, 148–149 (1979), the Court concluded that a federal
statute required school districts receiving certain federal funds to
remedy faculty segregation, even though in this Court’s view the
racial disparities in the affected schools were purely \\de facto\\
and would not have been actionable under the Equal Protection Clause.
Not even the dissenters thought the race-conscious remedial program
posed a \\constitutional\\ problem. See \\id.,\\ at 152 (opinion of
Stewart, J.). See also, \\e. g., Crawford\\ v. \\Board of Ed. of Los
Angeles,\\ 458 U. S. 527, 535–536 (1982) (“[S]tate courts of
California continue to have an obligation under state law to order
segregated school districts to use voluntary desegregation techniques,
\\whether or not therehas been a finding of intentional segregation.\\

reasonably feasible steps to desegregate, and \\they remain freeto adopt

Indeed, in 1968, the Illinois Supreme Court rejected an equal protection
challenge to a race-conscious state law seeking to undo \\de facto\\
segregation:

      “To support [their] claim, the defendants heavily rely on three
Federal cases, each of which held, no State law being involved, that a
local school board does not have an affirmative constitutional duty to
act to alleviate racial imbalance in the schools that it did not cause.
However, the question as to whether the constitution requires a local
school board, or a State, to act to undo \\defacto\\ school segregation
is simply not here concerned. The issue here is whether the constitution
permits, rather than prohibits, voluntary State action aimed toward
reducing and eventually eliminating \\de facto\\ school segregation.

      “State laws or administrative policies, directed toward the
reduction and eventual elimination of \\de facto\\ segregation of
children in the schools and racial imbalance, have been approved by
every high State court which has considered the issue. Similarly, the
Federal courts which have considered the issue . . . have recognized
that voluntary programs of local school authorities designed to
alleviate \\de facto\\ segregation and racial imbalance in the schools
are not constitutionally forbidden.” \\Tometz\\ v. \\Board of Ed.,

  I quote the Illinois Supreme Court at length to illustrate the
prevailing legal assumption at the time \\Swann\\ was decided. In this
respect, \\Swann\\ was not a sharp or unexpected departure from prior
rulings; it reflected a consensus that had already emerged among state
and lower federal courts.

  If there were doubts before \\Swann\\ was decided, they did not
survive this Court’s decision. Numerous state and federal courts
explicitly relied upon \\Swann\\’s guidance for decades to follow. For
instance, a Texas appeals court in 1986 rejected a Fourteenth Amendment
challenge to a voluntary integration plan by explaining:

    “[T]he absence of a court order to desegregate does not mean that
a school board cannot exceed minimum requirements in order to promote
school integration. School authorities are traditionally given broad
discretionary powers to formulate and implement educational policy
and may properly decide to ensure to their students the value of an
integrated school experience.” \\Citizens for Better Ed.\\ v. \\Goose
Creek Consol. Independent School Dist.,\\ 719 S. W. 2d 350, 352–353
(citing \\Swann\\ and \\North Carolina Bd. of Ed.\\), appeal dism’d
for want of substantial federal question, 484 U. S. 804 (1987).

Similarly, in \\Zaslawsky\\ v. \\Board of Ed. of Los Angeles CityUnified
School Dist.,\\ 610 F. 2d 661, 662–664 (1979), the Ninth Circuit
rejected a federal constitutional challenge to a school district’s use
of mandatory faculty transfers to ensure that each school’s faculty
makeup would fall within 10% of the districtwide racial composition.
Like the Texas court, the Ninth Circuit relied upon \\Swann\\ and
\\North Carolina Bd.\\ @@828@@ \\of Ed.\\ to reject the argument
that “a race-conscious plan is permissible only when there has
been a judicial finding of \\de jure\\ segregation.” 610 F. 2d, at
663–664. See also, \\e. g.,Darville\\ v. \\Dade Cty. School Bd.,\\ 497
F. 2d 1002, 1004–1006 (CA5 1974); \\State ex rel. Citizens Against
Mandatory Bussing\\ v. \\Brooks,\\ 80 Wash. 2d 121, 128–129, 492
P. 2d 536, 541– 542 (1972) (en banc), overruled on other grounds,
\\Cole\\ v. \\Webster,\\ 103 Wash. 2d 280, 692 P. 2d 799 (1984) (en

417, 428–429, 287 N. E. 2d 438, 447–448 (1972). These decisions
illustrate well how lower courts understood and followed \\Swann\\’s
enunciation of the relevant legal principle.

  Courts are not alone in accepting as constitutionally valid the legal
principle that \\Swann\\ enunciated—\\i. e.,\\ that the government
may voluntarily adopt race-conscious measures to improve conditions
of race even when it is not under a constitutional obligation to do
so. That principle has been accepted by every branch of government and
is rooted in the history of the Equal Protection Clause itself. Thus,
Congress has enacted numerous race-conscious statutes that illustrate
that principle or rely upon its validity. See, \\e. g.,\\ No Child
Left Behind Act of 2001, 20 U. S. C. § 6311(b)(2) (C)(v) (2000
ed., Supp. IV); § 1067 \\et seq.\\ (authorizing aid to minority
institutions). In fact, without being exhaustive, I have counted 51
federal statutes that use racial classifications. I have counted well
over 100 state statutes that similarly employ racial classifications.
Presidential administrations for the past half century have used and
supported various race-conscious measures. See, \\e. g.,\\ Exec. Order
No. 10925, 26 Fed. Reg. 1977 (1961) (President Kennedy); Exec. Order
No. 11246, 30 Fed. Reg. 12319 (1965) (President Johnson); Sugrue,
Breaking Through: The Troubled Origins of Affirmative Action in the
Workplace, in Color Lines: Affirmative Action, Immigration, and Civil
Rights Options for America 31 (J. Skrentny ed. 2001) (describing

Yale L. & Pol’y Rev. 1, 50 (2002) (describing President Carter’s
support for affirmation action). And during the same time, hundreds of
local school districts have adopted student assignment plans that use
race-conscious criteria. See Welch 83–91.

  That \\Swann\\’s legal statement should find such broad acceptance
is not surprising. For \\Swann\\ is predicated upon a well-established
legal view of the Fourteenth Amendment. That view understands the
basic objective of those who wrote the Equal Protection Clause as
forbidding practices that lead to racial exclusion. The Amendment sought
to bring into American society as full members those whom the Nation had
previously held in slavery. See \\Slaughter-House Cases,\\ 16 Wall. 36,
71 (1873) (“[N]o one can fail to be impressed with the one pervading
purpose found in [all the Reconstruction amendments] . . . we mean the
freedom of the slave race”); \\Strauder\\ v. \\West Virginia,\\ 100
U. S. 303, 306 (1880) (“[The Fourteenth Amendment] is one of a series
of constitutional provisions having a common purpose; namely, securing
to a race recently emancipated . . . all the civil rights that the superior
race enjoy”).

  There is reason to believe that those who drafted an Amendment
with this basic purpose in mind would have understood the legal and
practical difference between the use of race-conscious criteria in
defiance of that purpose, namely to keep the races apart, and the use
of race-conscious criteria to further that purpose, namely to bring
the races together. See generally R. Sears, A Utopian Experiment
in Kentucky: Integration and Social Equality at Berea, 1866–1904
(1996) (describing federal funding, through the Freedman’s Bureau,
of race-conscious school integration programs). See also R. Fischer,

& Public Education in the South, 1865–1877, pp. 111–116 (1974)
(same). Although the Constitution almost always forbids the former, it
is significantly more lenient in respect to the latter. See \\Gratz\\
v. \\Bollinger,\\ 539 U. S. 244, 301 (2003) (<<Ginsburg,>> J.,
dissenting); \\Adarand Constructors, Inc.\\ v. \\Pen˜ a,\\ 515 U. S.
200, 243 (1995) (<<Stevens,>> J., dissenting).

  Sometimes Members of this Court have disagreed about the degree of
leniency that the Clause affords to programs designed to include. See
\\Wygant\\ v. \\Jackson Bd. of Ed.,\\ 476 U. S. 267, 274 (1986);
\\Fullilove\\ v. \\Klutznick,\\ 448 U. S. 448, 507 (1980) (Powell, J.,
concurring). But I can find no case in which this Court has followed
<<Justice Thomas>>’ “colorblind” approach. And I have found no
case that otherwise repudiated this constitutional asymmetry between
that which seeks to \\exclude\\ and that which seeks to \\include\\
members of minority races.

  What does the plurality say in response? First, it seeks to
distinguish \\Swann\\ and other similar cases on the ground that those
cases involved remedial plans in response to \\judicial findings\\ of
\\de jure\\ segregation. As \\McDaniel\\ and \\Harris\\ show, that is
historically untrue. See \\supra,\\ at 824–825. Many school districts
in the South adopted segregation remedies (to which \\Swann\\ clearly
applies) without any such federal order, see \\supra,\\ at 821. See
also Kennedy Report. Seattle’s circumstances are not meaningfully
different from those in, say, \\McDaniel,\\ where this Court approved
raceconscious remedies. Louisville’s plan was created and initially
adopted when a compulsory district court order was in place. And, in
any event, the histories of Seattle and Louisville make clear that this
distinction—between court-ordered and voluntary desegregation—seeks
a line that sensibly cannot be drawn. @@831@@

  Second, the plurality downplays the importance of \\Swann\\ and
related cases by frequently describing their relevant statements as
“dicta.” These criticisms, however, miss the main point. \\Swann\\
did not hide its understanding of the law in a corner of an obscure
opinion or in a footnote, unread but by experts. It set forth its view
prominently in an important opinion joined by all nine Justices, knowing
that it would be read and followed throughout the Nation. The basic
problem with the plurality’s technical “dicta”-based response
lies in its overly theoretical approach to case law, an approach that
emphasizes rigid distinctions between holdings and dicta in a way
that serves to mask the radical nature of today’s decision. Law
is not an exercise in mathematical logic. And statements of a legal
rule set forth in a judicial opinion do not always divide neatly into
“holdings” and “dicta.” (Consider the legal “status” of
Justice Powell’s separate opinion in \\Regents of Univ. of Cal.\\
v. \\Bakke,\\ 438 U. S. 265 (1978).) The constitutional principle
enunciated in \\Swann,\\ reiterated in subsequent cases, and relied
upon over many years, provides, and has widely been thought to provide,
authoritative legal guidance. And if the plurality now chooses to reject
that principle, it cannot adequately justify its retreat simply by
affixing the label “dicta” to reasoning with which it disagrees.
Rather, it must explain to the courts and to the Nation \\why\\ it would
abandon guidance set forth many years before, guidance that countless
others have built upon over time, and which the law has continuously
embodied.

  Third, a more important response is the plurality’s claim that
later cases—in particular \\Johnson\\ v. \\California,\\ 543 U. S.
499 (2005), \\Adarand, supra,\\ and \\Grutter\\ v. \\Bollinger,\\ 539
U. S. 306 (2003)—supplanted \\Swann.\\ See \\ante,\\ at 720, 739, n.
16, 741–742 (citing \\Adarand, supra,\\ at 227; \\Johnson, supra,\\
at 505; \\Grutter, supra,\\ at 326). The plurality says that cases
such as \\Swann\\ and the others I have described all “were decided
before this Court definitively de@@832@@termined that ‘all racial
classifications . . . must be analyzed by a reviewing court under
strict scrutiny.’ ” \\Ante,\\ at 739, n. 16 (quoting \\Adarand,\\
515 U. S., at 227). This Court in \\Adarand\\ added that “such
classifications are constitutional only if they are narrowly tailored
measures that further compelling governmental interests.” \\Ibid.\\
And the Court repeated this same statement in \\Grutter.\\ See 539 U.
S., at 326.

  Several of these cases were significantly more restrictive than
\\Swann\\ in respect to the degree of leniency the Fourteenth Amendment
grants to programs designed to \\include\\ people of all races. See,
\\e. g., Adarand, supra; Gratz, supra;Grutter, supra.\\ But that legal
circumstance cannot make a critical difference here for two separate
reasons.

  First, no case—not \\Adarand, Gratz, Grutter,\\ or any other—has
ever held that the test of “strict scrutiny” means that all
racial classifications—no matter whether they seek to include or
exclude—must in practice be treated the same. The Court did not say in
\\Adarand\\ or in \\Johnson\\ or in \\Grutter\\ that it was overturning
\\Swann\\ or its central constitutional principle.

  Indeed, in its more recent opinions, the Court recognized that the
“fundamental purpose” of strict scrutiny review is to “take
relevant differences” between “fundamentally different situations
. . . into account.” \\Adarand,\\ 515 U. S., at 228 (internal
quotation marks omitted). The Court made clear that “[s]trict scrutiny
does not trea[t] dissimilar race-based decisions as though they were
equally objectionable.” \\Ibid.\\ (internal quotation marks omitted).
It added that the fact that a law “treats [a person] unequally because
of his or her race . . . says nothing about the ultimate validity of any
particular law.” \\Id.,\\ at 229–230. And the Court, using the very
phrase that Justice Marshall had used to describe strict scrutiny’s
application to any \\exclusionary\\ use of racial criteria, sought
to “\\dispel the notion\\ that strict scrutiny” is as likely to
condemn \\inclusive\\ uses of “race-conscious” criteria @@833@@ as
it is to invalidate \\exclusionary\\ uses. That is, it is \\not\\ in
all circumstances “ ‘strict in theory, but fatal in fact.’ ”
\\Id.,\\ at 237 (quoting \\Fullilove,\\ 448 U. S., at 519 (Marshall, J.,
concurring in judgment)).

  The Court in \\Grutter\\ elaborated:

      “Strict scrutiny is not ‘strict in theory, but fatal in
fact.’ . . . Although all governmental uses of race are subject to
strict scrutiny, not all are invalidated by it. . . .

      “Context matters when reviewing race-based governmental action

by an interpretive process of inclusion and exclusion, it is imperative
that generalizations, based on and qualified by the concrete situations
that gave rise to them, must not be applied out of context in disregard
of variant controlling facts’). . . . Not every decision influenced
by race is equally objectionable, and strict scrutiny is designed to
provide a framework for carefully examining the importance and the
sincerity of the reasons advanced by the governmental decisionmaker for
the use of race in that particular context.” 539 U. S., at 326–327.

The Court’s holding in \\Grutter\\ demonstrates that the Court
meant what it said, for the Court upheld an elite law school’s
race-conscious admissions program.

  The upshot is that the cases to which the plurality refers, though
all applying strict scrutiny, do not treat exclusive and inclusive uses
the same. Rather, they apply the strict scrutiny test in a manner that
is “fatal in fact” only to racial classifications that harmfully
\\exclude;\\ they apply the test in a manner that is \\not\\ fatal in
fact to racial classifications that seek to \\include.\\

  The plurality cannot avoid this simple fact. See \\ante,\\ at
741–743. Today’s opinion reveals that the plurality would @@834@@
rewrite this Court’s prior jurisprudence, at least in practical
application, transforming the “strict scrutiny” test into a rule
that is fatal in fact across the board. In doing so, the plurality
parts company from this Court’s prior cases, and it takes from local
government the longstanding legal right to use race-conscious criteria
for inclusive purposes in limited ways.

  Second, as \\Grutter\\ specified, “[c]ontext matters when reviewing
race-based governmental action under the Equal Protection Clause.” 539
U. S., at 327 (citing \\Gomillion\\ v. \\Lightfoot,\\ 364 U. S. 339,
343–344 (1960)). And contexts differ dramatically one from the other.
Governmental use of race-based criteria can arise in the context of, for
example, census forms, research expenditures for diseases, assignments
of police officers patrolling predominantly minority-race neighborhoods,
efforts to desegregate racially segregated schools, policies that favor
minorities when distributing goods or services in short supply, actions
that create majority-minority electoral districts, peremptory strikes
that remove potential jurors on the basis of race, and others. Given the
significant differences among these contexts, it would be surprising if
the law required an identically strict legal test for evaluating the
constitutionality of race-based criteria as to each of them.

  Here, the context is one in which school districts seek to advance
or to maintain racial integration in primary and secondary schools.
It is a context, as \\Swann\\ makes clear, where history has required
special administrative remedies. And it is a context in which the school
boards’ plans simply set race-conscious limits at the outer boundaries
of a broad range.

  This context is \\not\\ a context that involves the use of race to
decide who will receive goods or services that are normally distributed
on the basis of merit and which are in short supply. It is not one in
which race-conscious limits stigma@@835@@tize or exclude; the limits at
issue do not pit the races against each other or otherwise significantly
exacerbate racial tensions. They do not impose burdens unfairly upon
members of one race alone but instead seek benefits for members of all
races alike. The context here is one of racial limits that seek, not to
keep the races apart, but to bring them together.

  The importance of these differences is clear once one compares the
present circumstances with other cases where one or more of these
negative features are present. See, \\e. g.,Strauder,\\ 100 U. S. 303;
\\Yick Wo,\\ 118 U. S. 356; \\Brown,\\ 347 U. S. 483; \\Loving\\ v.
\\Virginia,\\ 388 U. S. 1 (1967); \\Bakke,\\ 438 U. S. 265; \\Batson\\
v. \\Kentucky,\\ 476 U. S. 79 (1986); \\Richmond\\ v. \\J. A. Croson
Co.,\\ 488 U. S. 469 (1989); \\Shaw\\ v. \\Reno,\\ 509 U. S. 630
(1993); \\Adarand,\\ 515 U. S. 200; \\Grutter, supra;Gratz,\\ 539
U. S. 244; \\Johnson,\\ 543 U. S. 499.

  If one examines the context more specifically, one finds that the
districts’ plans reflect efforts to overcome a history of segregation,
embody the results of broad experience and community consultation,
seek to expand student choice while reducing the need for mandatory
busing, and use race-conscious criteria in highly limited ways that
diminish the use of race compared to preceding integration efforts.
Compare \\Wessmann\\ v. \\Gittens,\\ 160 F. 3d 790, 809–810 (CA1
1998) (Boudin, J., concurring), with \\Comfort,\\ 418 F. 3d, at
28–29 (Boudin, C. J., concurring). They do not seek to award a
scarce commodity on the basis of merit, for they are not magnet
schools; rather, by design and in practice, they offer substantially
equivalent academic programs and electives. Although some parents or
children prefer some schools over others, school popularity has varied
significantly over the years. In 2000, for example, Roosevelt was the
most popular first choice high school in Seattle; in 2001, Ballard was
the most popular; in 2000, West Seattle was one of the least popular;
by 2003, it was one of the more popular. See Research, Evaluation and
Assessment, Student Information @@836@@ Services Office, Seattle Public
Schools, Data Profile: District Summary December 2005 (hereinafter Data
Profile: District Summary December 2005), online at http://www.seattle
schools.org/area/siso/disprof/2005/DP05all.pdf. In a word, the school
plans under review do not involve the kind of race-based harm that has
led this Court, in other contexts, to find the use of race-conscious
criteria unconstitutional.

  These and related considerations convinced one Ninth Circuit judge
in the Seattle case to apply a standard of constitutionality review
that is less than “strict,” and to conclude that this Court’s
precedents do not require the contrary. See 426 F. 3d 1162, 1193–1194
(2005) \\(Parents Involved VII)\\ (Kozinski, J., concurring) (“That
a student is denied the school of his choice may be disappointing,
but it carries no racial stigma and says nothing at all about that
individual’s aptitude or ability”). That judge is not alone. Cf.
\\Gratz,supra,\\ at 301 (<<Ginsburg,>> J., dissenting); \\Adarand,
supra,\\ at 243 (<<Stevens,>> J., dissenting); Carter, When Victims
Happen To Be Black, 97 Yale L. J. 420, 433–434 (1988).

  The view that a more lenient standard than “strict scrutiny”
should apply in the present context would not imply abandonment of
judicial efforts carefully to determine the need for race-conscious
criteria and the criteria’s tailoring in light of the need. And the
present context requires a court to examine carefully the race-conscious
program at issue. In doing so, a reviewing judge must be fully aware of
the potential dangers and pitfalls that <<Justice Thomas>> and <<Jus­>>
<<tice Kennedy>> mention. See \\ante,\\ at 757–759 (<<Thomas,>> J.,
concurring); \\ante,\\ at 783–784, 797 (<<Kennedy,>> J., concurring in
part and concurring in judgment).

  But unlike the plurality, such a judge would also be aware that a
legislature or school administrators, ultimately accountable to the
electorate, could \\nonetheless\\ properly conclude that a racial
classification sometimes serves a purpose important enough to overcome
the risks they mention, for @@837@@ example, helping to end racial
isolation or to achieve a diverse student body in public schools. Cf.
\\ante,\\ at 797–798 (opinion of <<Kennedy,>> J.). Where that is so,
the judge would carefully examine the program’s details to determine
whether the use of race-conscious criteria is proportionate to the
important ends it serves.

  In my view, this contextual approach to scrutiny is altogether
fitting. I believe that the law requires application here of a standard
of review that is not “strict” in the traditional sense of that
word, although it does require the careful review I have just described.
See \\Gratz, supra,\\ at 301 (<<Ginsburg,>> J., joined by <<Souter,>>
J., dissenting); \\Adarand,supra,\\ at 242–249 (<<Stevens,>> J.,
joined by <<Ginsburg,>> J., dissenting); \\Parents Involved VII,
supra,\\ at 1193–1194 (Kozinski, J., concurring). Apparently <<Justice
Kennedy>> also agrees that strict scrutiny would not apply in respect to
certain “race-conscious” school board policies. See \\ante,\\ at 789
(“Executive and legislative branches, which for generations now have
considered these types of policies and procedures, should be permitted
to employ them with candor and with confidence that a constitutional
violation does not occur whenever a decisionmaker considers the impact a
given approach might have on students of different races”).

  Nonetheless, in light of \\Grutter\\ and other precedents, see, \\e.
g., Bakke, supra,\\ at 290 (opinion of Powell, J.), I shall adopt the
first alternative. I shall apply the version of strict scrutiny that
those cases embody. I shall consequently ask whether the school boards
in Seattle and Louisville adopted these plans to serve a “compelling
governmental interest” and, if so, whether the plans are “narrowly
tailored” to achieve that interest. If the plans survive this strict
review, they would survive less exacting review \\a fortiori.\\ Hence, I
conclude that the plans before us pass both parts of the strict scrutiny
test. Consequently I must conclude that the plans here are permitted
under the Constitution. @@838@@


# III \\Applying the Legal Standard\\

## A \\Compelling Interest\\

  The principal interest advanced in these cases to justify the use of
race-based criteria goes by various names. Sometimes a court refers
to it as an interest in achieving racial “diversity.” Other times
a court, like the plurality here, refers to it as an interest in
racial “balancing.” I have used more general terms to signify that
interest, describing it, for example, as an interest in promoting or
preserving greater racial “integration” of public schools. By
this term, I mean the school districts’ interest in eliminating
school-by-school racial isolation and increasing the degree to which
racial mixture characterizes each of the district’s schools and each
individual student’s public school experience.

  Regardless of its name, however, the interest at stake possesses three
essential elements. First, there is a historical and remedial element:
an interest in setting right the consequences of prior conditions of
segregation. This refers back to a time when public schools were highly
segregated, often as a result of legal or administrative policies that
facilitated racial segregation in public schools. It is an interest in
continuing to combat the remnants of segregation caused in whole or in
part by these school-related policies, which have often affected not
only schools, but also housing patterns, employment practices, economic
conditions, and social attitudes. It is an interest in maintaining
hard-won gains. And it has its roots in preventing what gradually may
become the \\de facto\\ resegregation of America’s public schools.
See Part I, \\supra,\\ at 805–806; Appendix A, \\infra.\\ See also
\\ante,\\ at 797 (opinion of <<Kennedy,>> J.) (“This Nation has a
moral and ethical obligation to fulfill its historic commitment to
creating an integrated society that ensures equal opportunity for all of
its children”). @@839@@

  Second, there is an educational element: an interest in overcoming
the adverse educational effects produced by and associated with highly
segregated schools. Cf. \\Grutter,\\ 539 U.S., at 345 (<<Ginsburg,>>
J., concurring). Studies suggest that children taken from those schools
and placed in integrated settings often show positive academic gains.
See, \\e. g.,\\ Powell, Living and Learning: Linking Housing and
Education, in Pursuit of a Dream Deferred: Linking Housing and Education
Policy 15, 35 (J. Powell, G. Kearney, & V. Kay eds. 2001) (hereinafter
Powell); Hallinan, Diversity Effects on Student Outcomes: Social
Science Evidence, 59 Ohio St. L. J. 733, 741–742 (1998) (hereinafter
Hallinan).

  Other studies reach different conclusions. See, \\e. g.,\\ D. Armor,
Forced Justice (1995). See also \\ante,\\ at 761–763 (<<Thomas,>> J.,
concurring). But the evidence supporting an educational interest in
racially integrated schools is well established and strong enough to
permit a democratically elected school board reasonably to determine
that this interest is a compelling one.

  Research suggests, for example, that black children from segregated
educational environments significantly increase their achievement levels
once they are placed in a more integrated setting. Indeed, in Louisville
itself, the achievement gap between black and white elementary school
students grew substantially smaller (by seven percentage points) after
the integration plan was implemented in 1975. See Powell 35. Conversely,
to take another example, evidence from a district in Norfolk, Virginia,
shows that resegregated schools led to a decline in the achievement test
scores of children of all races. \\Ibid.\\

  One commentator, reviewing dozens of studies of the educational
benefits of desegregated schooling, found that the studies have provided
“remarkably consistent” results, showing that: (1) black students’
educational achievement is improved in integrated schools as compared to
racially isolated schools, (2) black students’ educational achievement
is im@@840@@proved in integrated classes, and (3) the earlier that
black students are removed from racial isolation, the better their
educational outcomes. See Hallinan 741–742. Multiple studies also
indicate that black alumni of integrated schools are more likely to
move into occupations traditionally closed to African-Americans, and to
earn more money in those fields. See, \\e. g.,\\ Schofield, Review of
Research on School Desegregation’s Impact on Elementary and Secondary
School Students, in Handbook of Research on Multicultural Education 597,
606–607 (J. Banks & C. Banks eds. 1995). Cf. W. Bowen & D. Bok, The
Shape of the River 118 (1998) (hereinafter Bowen & Bok).

  Third, there is a democratic element: an interest in producing an
educational environment that reflects the “pluralistic society” in
which our children will live. \\Swann,\\ 402 U. S., at 16. It is an
interest in helping our children learn to work and play together with
children of different racial backgrounds. It is an interest in teaching
children to engage in the kind of cooperation among Americans of all
races that is necessary to make a land of 300 million people one Nation.

  Again, data support this insight. See, \\e. g.,\\ Hallinan 745;
Quillian & Campbell, Beyond Black and White: The Present and Future
of Multiracial Friendship Segregation, 68 Am. Sociological Rev. 540,
541 (2003) (hereinafter Quillian & Campbell); Dawkins & Braddock, The
Continuing Significance of Desegregation: School Racial Composition
and African American Inclusion in American Society, 63 J. Negro Educ.
394, 401–403 (1994) (hereinafter Dawkins & Braddock); Wells & Crain,
Perpetuation Theory and the Long-Term Effects of School Desegregation,
64 Rev. Educ. Research 531, 550 (1994) (hereinafter Wells & Crain).

  There are again studies that offer contrary conclusions. See, \\e.
g.,\\ Schofield, School Desegregation and Intergroup Relations: A
Review of the Literature, in 17 Review of Research in Education 335,
356 (G. Grant ed. 1991). See also \\ante,\\ at 768–770 (<<Thomas,>>
J., concurring). Again, however, @@841@@ the evidence supporting a
democratic interest in racially integrated schools is firmly established
and sufficiently strong to permit a school board to determine, as this
Court has itself often found, that this interest is compelling.

  For example, one study documented that “black and white students
in desegregated schools are less racially prejudiced than those
in segregated schools,” and that “interracial contact in
desegregated schools leads to an increase in interracial sociability and
friendship.” Hallinan 745. See also Quillian & Campbell 541. Cf. Bowen
& Bok 155. Other studies have found that both black and white students
who attend integrated schools are more likely to work in desegregated
companies after graduation than students who attended racially isolated
schools. Dawkins & Braddock 401– 403; Wells & Crain 550. Further
research has shown that the desegregation of schools can help bring
adult communities together by reducing segregated housing. Cities that
have implemented successful school desegregation plans have witnessed
increased interracial contact and neighborhoods that tend to become less
racially segregated. Dawkins & Braddock 403. These effects not only
reinforce the prior gains of integrated primary and secondary education;
they also foresee a time when there is less need to use raceconscious
criteria.

  Moreover, this Court from \\Swann\\ to \\Grutter\\ has treated
these civic effects as an important virtue of racially diverse
education. See, \\e. g., Swann, supra,\\ at 16; \\Seattle SchoolDist.
No. 1,\\ 458 U. S., at 472–473. In \\Grutter,\\ in the context of
law school admissions, we found that these types of interests were,
constitutionally speaking, “compelling.” See 539 U. S., at 330
(recognizing that Michigan Law School’s raceconscious admissions
policy “promotes cross-racial understanding, helps to break down
racial stereotypes, and enables [students] to better understand persons
of different races,” and pointing out that “the skills needed
in today’s increasingly global marketplace can only be developed
through ex@@842@@posure to widely diverse people, cultures, ideas,
and viewpoints” (internal quotation marks omitted; alteration in
original)).

  In light of this Court’s conclusions in \\Grutter,\\ the
“compelling” nature of these interests in the context of primary
and secondary public education follows here \\a fortiori.\\ Primary and
secondary schools are where the education of this Nation’s children
begins, where each of us begins to absorb those values we carry with us
to the end of our days. As Justice Marshall said, “unless our children
begin to learn together, there is little hope that our people will ever
learn to live together.” \\Milliken\\ v. \\Bradley,\\ 418 U. S. 717,
783 (1974) (dissenting opinion).

  And it was \\Brown,\\ after all, focusing upon primary and secondary
schools, not \\Sweatt\\ v. \\Painter,\\ 339 U. S. 629 (1950), focusing
on law schools, or \\McLaurin\\ v. \\Oklahoma State Regents for Higher
Ed.,\\ 339 U. S. 637 (1950), focusing on graduate schools, that
affected so deeply not only Americans but the world. R. Kluger, Simple
Justice: The History of \\Brownv. Board of Education\\ and Black
America’s Struggle for Equality, p. x (1975) (arguing that perhaps
no other Supreme Court case has “affected more directly the minds,
hearts, and daily lives of so many Americans”); J. Patterson, Brown
v. Board of Education, p. xxvii (2001) (identifying \\Brown\\ as “the
most eagerly awaited and dramatic judicial decision of modern times”).
See also \\Parents Involved VII,\\ 426 F. 3d, at 1194 (Kozinski, J.,
concurring); Strauss, Discriminatory Intent and the Taming of \\Brown,\\
56 U. Chi. L. Rev. 935, 937 (1989) (calling \\Brown\\ “the Supreme
Court’s greatest antidiscrimination decision”); Brief for United
States as \\AmicusCuriae\\ in \\Brown,\\ O. T. 1952, No. 8 etc.;
Dudziak, \\Brown\\ as a Cold War Case, 91 J. Am. Hist. 32 (2004);
A Great Decision, Hindustan Times (New Delhi, May 20, 1954), p. 5;
USA Takes Positive Step, West African Pilot (Lagos, May 22, 1954),
p. 2 (stating that \\Brown\\ is an acknowledgment that the “United
States should set an example for all other nations by taking @@843@@
the lead in removing from its national life all signs and traces of
racial intolerance, arrogance or discrimination”). Hence, I am not
surprised that <<Justice Kennedy>> finds that “a district may consider
it a compelling interest to achieve a diverse student population,”
including a \\racially\\ diverse population. \\Ante,\\ at 797–798.

  The compelling interest at issue here, then, includes an effort to
eradicate the remnants, not of general “societal discrimination,”
\\ante,\\ at 731 (plurality opinion), but of primary and secondary
school segregation, see \\supra,\\ at 808–809, 813–814; it includes
an effort to create school environments that provide better educational
opportunities for all children; it includes an effort to help create
citizens better prepared to know, to understand, and to work with people
of all races and backgrounds, thereby furthering the kind of democratic
government our Constitution foresees. If an educational interest that
combines these three elements is not “compelling,” what is?

  The majority acknowledges that in prior cases this Court has
recognized at least two interests as compelling: an interest in
“remedying the effects of past intentional discrimination,” and an
interest in “diversity in higher education.” \\Ante,\\ at 720, 722.
But the plurality does not convincingly explain why those interests do
not constitute a “compelling interest” here. How do the remedial
interests here differ in kind from those at issue in the voluntary
desegregation efforts that Attorney General Kennedy many years ago
described in his letter to the President? \\Supra,\\ at 821. How do the
educational and civic interests differ in kind from those that underlie
and justify the racial “diversity” that the law school sought in
\\Grutter,\\ where this Court found a compelling interest?

  The plurality tries to draw a distinction by reference to the
well-established conceptual difference between \\de jure\\ segregation
(“segregation by state action”) and \\de facto\\ segregation
(“racial imbalance caused by other factors”). \\Ante,\\ @@844@@ at
736. But that distinction concerns what the Constitution \\requires\\
school boards to do, not what it \\permits\\ them to do. Compare, \\e.
g., Green,\\ 391 U. S., at 437–438 (“School boards . . . operating
state-compelled dual systems” have an “affirmative duty to take
whatever steps might be necessary to convert to a unitary system in
which racial discrimination would be eliminated root and branch”),
with, \\e. g., Milliken,supra,\\ at 745 (the Constitution does not
impose a duty to desegregate upon districts that have not been “shown
to have committed any constitutional violation”).

  The opinions cited by the plurality to justify its reliance upon the
\\de jure/de facto\\ distinction only address what remedial measures a
school district may be constitutionally \\required\\ to undertake. See,
\\e. g., Freeman\\ v. \\Pitts,\\ 503 U. S. 467, 495 (1992). As to what
is \\permitted,\\ nothing in our equal protection law suggests that a
State may right only those wrongs that it committed. No case of this
Court has ever relied upon the \\de jure/de facto\\ distinction in order
to limit what a school district is voluntarily allowed to do. That is
what is at issue here. And \\Swann, McDaniel, Crawford, North Carolina
Bd. of Ed., Harris,\\ and \\Bustop\\ made one thing clear: significant
as the difference between \\de jure\\ and \\de facto\\ segregation
may be to the question of what a school district \\must\\ do, that
distinction is not germane to the question of what a school district
\\may\\ do.

  Nor does any precedent indicate, as the plurality suggests with
respect to Louisville, \\ante,\\ at 737, that remedial interests vanish
the day after a federal court declares that a district is “unitary.”
Of course, Louisville adopted those portions of the plan at issue here
\\before\\ a court declared Louisville “unitary.” Moreover, in
\\Freeman,\\ this Court pointed out that in “one sense of the term,
vestiges of past segregation by state decree do remain in our society
and in our schools. Past wrongs to the black race, wrongs committed
by the State and in its name, are a stubborn fact of @@845@@ history.
And stubborn facts of history linger and persist.” 503 U. S., at
495. See also \\ante,\\ at 795 (opinion of <<Kennedy,>> J.). I do not
understand why this Court’s cases, which rest the significance of
a “unitary” finding in part upon the wisdom and desirability of
returning schools to local control, should deprive those local officials
of legal \\permission\\ to use means they once found necessary to combat
persisting injustices.

  For his part, <<Justice Thomas>> faults my citation of various
studies supporting the view that school districts can find compelling
educational and civic interests in integrating their public schools.
See \\ante,\\ at 761–763, 768–769 (concurring opinion). He is
entitled of course to his own opinion as to which studies he finds
convincing—although it bears mention that even the author of some of
<<Justice Thomas>>’ preferred studies has found \\some\\ evidence
linking integrated learning environments to increased academic
achievement. Compare \\ante,\\ at 761–763 (opinion of <<Thomas,>>
J.) (citing Armor & Rossell, Desegregation and Resegregation in the
Public Schools, in Beyond the Color Line: New Perspectives on Race
and Ethnicity in America 219, 239, 251 (A. Thernstrom & S. Thernstrom
eds. 2002); Brief for David J. Armor et al. as \\Amici Curiae\\ 29),
with Rosen, Perhaps Not All Affirmative Action is Created Equal,
N. Y. Times, June 11, 2006, section 4, p. 14 (quoting David Armor
as commenting, “ ‘we did not find the [racial] achievement gap
changing \\significantly\\’ ” but acknowledging that he “ ‘did
find a modest association for math but not reading in terms of racial
composition and achievement, but there’s a big state variation’ ”
(emphasis added)). If we are to insist upon unanimity in the social
science literature before finding a compelling interest, we might never
find one. I believe only that the Constitution allows democratically
elected school boards to make up their own minds as to how best to
include people of all races in one America. @@846@@


## B \\Narrow Tailoring\\

  I next ask whether the plans before us are “narrowly tailored”
to achieve these “compelling” objectives. I shall not accept the
school boards’ assurances on faith, cf. \\Miller\\ v. \\Johnson,\\
515 U. S. 900, 920 (1995), and I shall subject the “tailoring” of
their plans to “rigorous judicial review,” \\Grutter,\\ 539 U. S.,
at 388 (<<Kennedy,>> J., dissenting). Several factors, taken together,
nonetheless lead me to conclude that the boards’ use of race-conscious
criteria in these plans passes even the strictest “tailoring” test.

  First, the race-conscious criteria at issue only help set the outer
bounds of \\broad\\ ranges. Cf. \\id.,\\ at 390 (expressing concern
about “narrow fluctuation band[s]”). They constitute but one part
of plans that depend primarily upon other, nonracial elements. To use
race in this way is not to set a forbidden “quota.” See \\id.,\\ at
335 (opinion of the Court) (“Properly understood, a ‘quota’ is a
program in which a certain fixed number or proportion of opportunities
are ‘reserved exclusively for certain minority groups’ ” (quoting
\\Croson,\\ 488 U. S., at 496 (plurality opinion))).

  In fact, the defining feature of both plans is greater emphasis
upon student choice. In Seattle, for example, in more than 80% of all
cases, that choice alone determines which high schools Seattle’s
ninth graders will attend. After ninth grade, students can decide
voluntarily to transfer to a preferred district high school (without
any consideration of race-conscious criteria). \\Choice,\\ therefore,
is the “predominant factor” in these plans. \\Race\\ is not. See
\\Grutter,supra,\\ at 393 (<<Kennedy,>> J., dissenting) (allowing
consideration of race only if it does “not become a predominant
factor”).

  Indeed, the race-conscious ranges at issue in these cases often have
no effect, either because the particular school is not oversubscribed in
the year in question, or because the @@847@@ racial makeup of the school
falls within the broad range, or because the student is a transfer
applicant or has a sibling at the school. In these respects, the broad
ranges are less like a quota and more like the kinds of “useful
starting points” that this Court has consistently found permissible,
even when they set boundaries upon voluntary transfers, and even when
they are based upon a community’s general population. See, \\e.
g., North Carolina Bd. of Ed.\\ v. \\Swann,\\ 402 U. S., at 46 (no
“absolute prohibition against [the] use” of mathematical ratios as
a “starting point”); \\Swann\\ v. \\Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of
Ed.,\\ 402 U. S., at 24–25 (approving the use of a ratio reflecting
“the racial composition of the whole school system” as a “useful
starting point,” but not as an “inflexible requirement”). Cf.
\\United States\\ v. \\Montgomery County Bd. of Ed.,\\ 395 U. S. 225,
232 (1969) (approving a lower court desegregation order that “provided
that the [school] board must move toward a goal under which ‘in each
school the ratio of white to Negro faculty members is substantially
the same as it is throughout the system,’ ” and “immediately”
requiring “[t]he ratio of Negro to white teachers” in each school
to be equal to “the ratio of Negro to white teachers in . . . the
system as a whole”).

  Second, broad-range limits on voluntary school choice plans are less
burdensome, and hence more narrowly tailored, see \\Grutter, supra,\\ at
341, than other race-conscious restrictions this Court has previously
approved. See, \\e. g.,Swann, supra,\\ at 26–27; \\Montgomery County
Bd. of Ed.,supra,\\ at 232. Indeed, the plans before us are \\more
narrowly tailored\\ than the race-conscious admission plans that this
Court approved in \\Grutter.\\ Here, race becomes a factor only in a
fraction of students’ non-merit-based assignments—not in large
numbers of students’ merit-based applications. Moreover, the effect of
applying race-conscious criteria here affects potentially disadvantaged
students \\lessseverely,\\ not more severely, than the criteria at issue
in \\Grutter.\\ Disappointed students are not rejected from a @@848@@
State’s flagship graduate program; they simply attend a different one
of the district’s many public schools, which in aspiration and in fact
are substantially equal. Cf. \\Wygant,\\ 476 U. S., at 283 (plurality
opinion). And, in Seattle, the disadvantaged student loses at most one
year at the high school of his choice. One will search \\Grutter\\ in
vain for similarly persuasive evidence of narrow tailoring as the school
districts have presented here.

  Third, the manner in which the school boards developed these plans
itself reflects “narrow tailoring.” Each plan was devised to
overcome a history of segregated public schools. Each plan embodies the
results of local experience and community consultation. Each plan is the
product of a process that has sought to enhance student choice, while
diminishing the need for mandatory busing. And each plan’s use of
race-conscious elements is \\diminished\\ compared to the use of race in
preceding integration plans.

  The school boards’ widespread consultation, their experimentation
with numerous other plans, indeed, the 40-year history that Part I
sets forth, make clear that plans that are less explicitly race-based
are unlikely to achieve the boards’ “compelling” objectives.
The history of each school system reveals highly segregated schools,
followed by remedial plans that involved forced busing, followed by
efforts to attract or retain students through the use of plans that
abandoned busing and replaced it with greater student choice. Both
cities once tried to achieve more integrated schools by relying solely
upon measures such as redrawn district boundaries, new school building
construction, and unrestricted voluntary transfers. In neither city
did these prior attempts prove sufficient to achieve the city’s
integration goals. See Parts I–A and I–B, \\supra,\\ at 807–819.

  Moreover, giving some degree of weight to a local school board’s
knowledge, expertise, and concerns in these particular matters is not
inconsistent with rigorous judicial scrutiny. It simply recognizes that
judges are not well suited to act @@849@@ as school administrators.
Indeed, in the context of school desegregation, this Court has
repeatedly stressed the importance of acknowledging that local school
boards better understand their own communities and have a better
knowledge of what in practice will best meet the educational needs of
their pupils. See \\Milliken,\\ 418 U. S., at 741–742 (“No single
tradition in public education is more deeply rooted than local control
over the operation of schools; local autonomy has long been thought
essential both to the maintenance of community concern and support for
public schools and to quality of the educational process”). See also
\\San Antonio Independent School Dist.\\ v. \\Rodriguez,\\ 411 U. S.
1, 49–50 (1973) (extolling local control for “the opportunity it
offers for participation in the decisionmaking process that determines
how . . . local tax dollars will be spent. Each locality is free
to tailor local programs to local needs. Pluralism also affords some
opportunity for experimentation, innovation, and a healthy competition
for educational excellence”); \\Epperson\\ v. \\Arkansas,\\ 393
U. S. 97, 104 (1968) (“Judicial interposition in the operation
of the public school system of the Nation raises problems requiring
care and restraint. . . . By and large, public education in our
Nation is committed to the control of state and local authorities”);
\\Brown\\ v. \\Board of Education,\\ 349 U. S. 294, 299 (1955) (“Full
implementation of these constitutional principles may require solution
of varied local school problems. School authorities have the primary
responsibility for elucidating, assessing, and solving these problems;
courts will have to consider whether the action of school authorities
constitutes good faith implementation of the governing constitutional
principles”).

  Experience in Seattle and Louisville is consistent with experience
elsewhere. In 1987, the U. S. Commission on Civil Rights studied 125
large school districts seeking integration. It reported that most
districts—92 of them, in fact—adopted desegregation policies that
combined two or more highly @@850@@ race-conscious strategies, for
example, rezoning or pairing. See Welch 83–91.

  Having looked at dozens of \\amicus\\ briefs, public reports, news
stories, and the records in many of this Court’s prior cases, which
together span 50 years of desegregation history in school districts
across the Nation, I have discovered many examples of districts that
sought integration through explicitly race-conscious methods, including
mandatory busing. Yet, I have found \\no\\ example or model that would
permit this Court to say to Seattle and to Louisville: “Here is
an instance of a desegregation plan that is likely to achieve your
objectives and also makes less use of race-conscious criteria than your
plans.” And, if the plurality cannot suggest such a model—and it
cannot—then it seeks to impose a “narrow tailoring” requirement
that in practice would never be met.

  Indeed, if there is no such plan, or if such plans are purely
imagined, it is understandable why, as the Court notes, \\ante,\\
at 733–734, Seattle school officials concentrated on diminishing
the racial component of their districts’ plan, but did not pursue
eliminating that element entirely. For the Court now to insist as it
does, \\ante,\\ at 735, that these school districts ought to have said
so officially is either to ask for the superfluous (if they need only
make explicit what is implicit) or to demand the impossible (if they
must somehow provide more proof that there is no hypothetical \\other\\
plan that could work as well as theirs). I am not aware of any case in
which this Court has read the “narrow tailoring” test to impose such
a requirement. Cf. \\People Who Care\\ v. \\Rockford Bd.of Ed. School
Dist. No. 205,\\ 961 F. 2d 1335, 1338 (CA7 1992) (Easterbrook, J.)
(“Would it be necessary to adjudicate the obvious before adopting (or
permitting the parties to agree on) a remedy . . . ?”).

  The plurality also points to the school districts’ use of numerical
goals based upon the racial breakdown of the general school population,
and it faults the districts for failing to prove that \\no other
set of numbers will work.\\ See \\ante,\\ at @@851@@ 726–728. The
plurality refers to no case in support of its demand. Nor is it likely
to find such a case. After all, this Court has in many cases explicitly
permitted districts to use target ratios based upon the district’s
underlying population. See, \\e. g., Swann,\\ 402 U. S., at 24–25;
\\North Carolina Bd. ofEd.,\\ 402 U. S., at 46; \\Montgomery County
Bd. of Ed.,\\ 395 U. S., at 232. The reason is obvious: In Seattle,
where the overall student population is 41% white, permitting 85% white
enrollment at a single school would make it much more likely that other
schools would have very few white students, whereas in Jefferson County,
with a 60% white enrollment, one school with 85% white students would be
less likely to skew enrollments elsewhere.

  Moreover, there is research-based evidence supporting, for example,
that a ratio no greater than 50% minority—which is Louisville’s
starting point, and as close as feasible to Seattle’s starting
point—is helpful in limiting the risk of “white flight.” See
Orfield, Metropolitan School Desegregation: Impacts on Metropolitan
Society, in Pursuit of a Dream Deferred: Linking Housing and Education
Policy 121, 125. Federal law also assumes that a similar target
percentage will help avoid detrimental “minority group isolation.”
See No Child Left Behind Act of 2001, Title V, Part C, 115 Stat.
1806, 20 U. S. C. § 7231 \\et seq.\\ (2000 ed., Supp. IV); 34 CFR
§§ 280.2, 280.4 (2006) (implementing regulations). What other numbers
are the boards to use as a “starting point”? Are they to spend days,
weeks, or months seeking independently to validate the use of ratios
that this Court has repeatedly authorized in prior cases? Are they
to draw numbers out of thin air? These districts have followed this
Court’s holdings and advice in “tailoring” their plans. That, too,
strongly supports the lawfulness of their methods.

  Nor could the school districts have accomplished their desired aims
(\\e. g.,\\ avoiding forced busing, countering white flight, maintaining
racial diversity) by other means. Nothing in the extensive history
of desegregation efforts over the @@852@@ past 50 years gives the
districts, or this Court, any reason to believe that another method is
possible to accomplish these goals. Nevertheless, <<Justice Kennedy>>
suggests that school boards

    “may pursue the goal of bringing together students of diverse
backgrounds and races through other means, including strategic site
selection of new schools; drawing attendance zones with general
recognition of the demographics of neighborhoods; allocating resources
for special programs; recruiting students and faculty in a targeted
fashion; and tracking enrollments, performance, and other statistics by
race.” \\Ante,\\ at 789.

But, as to “strategic site selection,” Seattle has built one new
high school in the last 44 years (and that specialized school serves
only 300 students). In fact, six of the Seattle high schools involved
in this case were built by the 1920’s; the other four were open by
the early 1960’s. See generally N. Thompson & C. Marr, Building for
Learning: Seattle Public School Histories, 1862–2000 (2002). As to
“drawing” neighborhood “attendance zones” on a racial basis,
Louisville tried it, and it worked only when forced busing was also part
of the plan. See \\supra,\\ at 814–816. As to “allocating resources
for special programs,” Seattle and Louisville have both experimented
with this; indeed, these programs are often referred to as “magnet
schools,” but the limited desegregation effect of these efforts
extends at most to those few schools to which additional resources are
granted. In addition, there is no evidence from the experience of these
school districts that it will make any meaningful impact. See Brief for
Respondents in No. 05–908, p. 42. As to “recruiting faculty” on
the basis of race, both cities have tried, but only as one part of a
broader program. As to “tracking enrollments, performance, and other
statistics by race,” tracking \\reveals\\ the problem; it does not
cure it. @@853@@

  <<Justice Kennedy>> sets forth two additional concerns related to
“narrow tailoring.” In respect to Louisville, he says first that
officials stated (1) that kindergarten assignments are not subject to
the race-conscious guidelines, and (2) that the child at issue here
was denied permission to attend the kindergarten he wanted because
of those guidelines. Both, he explains, cannot be true. He adds that
this confusion illustrates that Louisville’s assignment plan (or its
explanation of it to this Court) is insufficiently precise in respect
to “who makes the decisions,” “oversight,” “the precise
circumstances in which an assignment decision” will be made; and
“which of two similarly situated children will be subjected to a given
race-based decision.” \\Ante,\\ at 785.

  The record suggests, however, that the child in question was not
assigned to the school he preferred because he missed the kindergarten
application deadline. See App. in No. 05–915, p. 20. After he had
enrolled and after the academic year had begun, he then applied to
transfer to his preferred school after the kindergarten assignment
deadline had passed, \\id.,\\ at 21, possibly causing school officials
to treat his late request as an application to transfer to the first
grade, in respect to which the guidelines apply. I am not certain
just how the remainder of <<Justice Kennedy>>’s concerns affect the
lawfulness of the Louisville program, for they seem to be failures of
explanation, not of administration. But Louisville should be able to
answer the relevant questions on remand.

  <<Justice Kennedy>>’s second concern is directly related
to the merits of Seattle’s plan: Why does Seattle’s plan
group Asian-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, Native-Americans, and
African-Americans together, treating all as similar minorities?
\\Ante,\\ at 786–787. The majority suggests that Seattle’s
classification system could permit a school to be labeled “diverse”
with a 50% Asian-American and 50% white student body, and no
African-American students, Hispanic @@854@@ students, or students
of other ethnicity. \\Ante,\\ at 787 (opinion of <<Kennedy, J.>>);
\\ante,\\ at 723–724 (opinion of the Court).

  The 50/50 hypothetical has no support in the record here; it is
conjured from the imagination. In fact, Seattle apparently began
to treat these different minority groups alike in response to the
federal Emergency School Aid Act’s requirement that it do so. A.
Siqueland, Without A Court Order: The Desegregation of Seattle’s
Schools 116–117 (1981) (hereinafter Siqueland). See also F. Hanawalt
& R. Williams, The History of Desegregation in Seattle Public Schools,
1954–1981, p. 31 (1981) (hereinafter Hanawalt); Pub. L. 95– 561,
Title VI, 92 Stat. 2252 (prescribing percentage enrollment requirements
for “minority” students); Siqueland 55 (discussing Department of
Health, Education, and Welfare’s definition of “minority”).
Moreover, maintaining this federally mandated system of classification
makes sense insofar as Seattle’s experience indicates that the
relevant circumstances in respect to each of these different minority
groups are roughly similar, \\e. g.,\\ in terms of residential patterns,
and call for roughly similar responses. This is confirmed by the fact
that Seattle has been able to achieve a desirable degree of diversity
without the \\greater\\ emphasis on race that drawing fine lines among
minority groups would require. Does the plurality’s view of the Equal
Protection Clause mean that courts must give no weight to such a board
determination? Does it insist upon especially strong evidence supporting
inclusion of multiple minority groups in an otherwise lawful government
minority-assistance program? If so, its interpretation threatens to
produce divisiveness among minority groups that is incompatible with the
basic objectives of the Fourteenth Amendment. Regardless, the plurality
cannot object that the constitutional defect is the individualized
use of race and simultaneously object that not enough account of
individuals’ race has been taken.

  Finally, I recognize that the Court seeks to distinguish \\Grutter\\
from these cases by claiming that \\Grutter\\ arose in @@855@@ “‘the
context of higher education.’” \\Ante,\\ at 725. But that is not a
meaningful legal distinction. I have explained why I do not believe the
Constitution could possibly find “compelling” the provision of a
racially diverse education for a 23-year-old law student but not for a
13-year-old high school pupil. See \\supra,\\ at 841–843. And I have
explained how the plans before us are more narrowly tailored than those
in \\Grutter.\\ See \\supra,\\ at 847–848. I add that one cannot find
a relevant distinction in the fact that these school districts did not
examine the merits of applications “individual[ly].” See \\ante,\\
at 722–723. The context here does not involve admission by merit; a
child’s academic, artistic, and athletic “merits” are not at all
relevant to the child’s placement. These are not affirmative action
plans, and hence “individualized scrutiny” is simply beside the
point.

  The upshot is that these plans’ specific features—(1) their
limited and historically diminishing use of race, (2) their strong
reliance upon other non-race-conscious elements, (3) their history and
the manner in which the districts developed and modified their approach,
(4) the comparison with prior plans, and (5) the lack of reasonably
evident alternatives—together show that the districts’ plans are
“narrowly tailored” to achieve their “compelling” goals. In sum,
the districts’ race-conscious plans satisfy “strict scrutiny” and
are therefore lawful.

# IV \\Direct Precedent\\

  Two additional precedents more directly related to the plans here at
issue reinforce my conclusion. The first consists of the District Court
determination in the Louisville case when it dissolved its desegregation
order that there was “overwhelming evidence of the Board’s good
faith compliance with the desegregation Decree and its underlying
purposes,” indeed that the board had “treated the ideal of an
integrated system as much more than a legal obligation—they consider
@@856@@ it a positive, desirable policy and an essential element of any
well-rounded public school education.” \\Hampton\\ v. \\Jefferson Cty.
Bd. of Ed.,\\ 102 F. Supp. 2d 358, 370 (WD Ky. 2000) \\(Hampton II).\\
When the court made this determination in 2000, it did so in the context
of the Louisville desegregation plan that the board had adopted in 1996.
That plan, which took effect before 1996, is the very plan that in all
relevant respects is in effect now and is the subject of the present
challenge.

  No one claims that (the relevant portion of) Louisville’s plan was
unlawful in 1996 when Louisville adopted it. To the contrary, there
is every reason to believe that it represented part of an effort to
implement the 1978 desegregation order. But if the plan was lawful
when it was first adopted and if it was lawful the day before the
District Court dissolved its order, how can the plurality now suggest
that it became \\unlawful\\ the following day? Is it conceivable that
the Constitution, implemented through a court desegregation order,
could permit (perhaps \\require\\) the district to make use of a
race-conscious plan the day before the order was dissolved and then
\\forbid\\ the district to use the identical plan the day after? See
\\id.,\\ at 380 (“The very analysis for dissolving desegregation
decrees supports continued maintenance of a desegregated system as
a compelling state interest”). The Equal Protection Clause is
not incoherent. And federal courts would rightly hesitate to find
unitary status if the consequences of the ruling were so dramatically
disruptive.

  Second, \\Seattle School Dist. No. 1,\\ 458 U. S. 457, is directly
on point. That case involves the original Seattle Plan, a \\more
heavily race-conscious predecessor\\ of the very plan now before us.
In \\Seattle School Dist. No. 1,\\ this Court struck down a state
referendum that effectively barred implementation of Seattle’s
desegregation plan and “burden[ed] all future attempts to integrate
Washington schools in districts throughout the State.” \\Id.,\\ at
462–463, 483. Because @@857@@ the referendum would have prohibited the
adoption of a school integration plan that involved mandatory busing,
and because it would have imposed a special burden on school integration
plans (plans that sought to integrate previously segregated schools),
the Court found it unconstitutional. \\Id.,\\ at 483–487.

  In reaching this conclusion, the Court did not directly address the
constitutional merits of the underlying Seattle Plan. But it explicitly
cited \\Swann\\’s statement that the Constitution permitted a local
district to adopt such a plan. 458 U. S., at 472, n. 15. It also cited
to Justice Powell’s opinion in \\Bakke, approving of\\ the limited use
of race-conscious criteria in a university-admissions “affirmative
action” case. 458 U. S., at 472, n. 15. In addition, the Court
stated that “[a]ttending an ethnically diverse school,” \\id.,\\
at 473, could help prepare “minority children for citizenship in our
pluralistic society,” hopefully “teaching members of the racial
majority to live in harmony and mutual respect with children of minority
heritage.” \\Ibid.\\ (internal quotation marks omitted).

  It is difficult to believe that the Court that held unconstitutional
a referendum that would have interfered with the implementation of this
plan thought that the integration plan it sought to preserve was itself
an \\unconstitutional\\ plan. And if \\Seattle School Dist. No. 1\\ is
premised upon the constitutionality of the original Seattle Plan, it is
equally premised upon the constitutionality of the present plan, for the
present plan \\is\\ the Seattle Plan, modified only insofar as it places
even \\less\\ emphasis on race-conscious elements than its predecessors.

  It is even more difficult to accept the plurality’s contrary view,
namely, that the underlying plan was unconstitutional. If that is so,
then \\all\\ of Seattle’s earlier (even more race-conscious) plans
must also have been unconstitutional. That necessary implication of
the plurality’s position strikes the 13th chime of the clock. How
could the plurality adopt a @@858@@ constitutional standard that would
hold unconstitutional large numbers of race-conscious integration plans
adopted by numerous school boards over the past 50 years while remaining
true to this Court’s desegregation precedent?

# V \\Consequences\\

  The Founders meant the Constitution as a practical document that would
transmit its basic values to future generations through principles
that remained workable over time. Hence it is important to consider
the potential consequences of the plurality’s approach, as measured
against the Constitution’s objectives. To do so provides further
reason to believe that the plurality’s approach is legally unsound.

  For one thing, consider the effect of the plurality’s views on the
parties before us and on similar school districts throughout the Nation.
Will Louisville and all similar school districts have to return to
systems like Louisville’s initial 1956 plan, which did not consider
race at all? See \\supra,\\ at 813–814. That initial 1956 plan proved
ineffective. Sixteen years into the plan, 14 of 19 middle and high
schools remained almost totally white or almost totally black. \\Ibid.\\

  The districts’ past and current plans are not unique. They resemble
other plans, promulgated by hundreds of local school boards, which have
attempted a variety of desegregation methods that have evolved over time
in light of experience. A 1987 Civil Rights Commission study of 125
school districts in the Nation demonstrated the breadth and variety of
desegregation plans:

      “The [study] documents almost 300 desegregation plans that were
implemented between 1961 and 1985. The degree of heterogeneity within
these districts is immediately apparent. They are located in every
region of the country and range in size from Las Cruces, New Mexico,
with barely over 15,000 students attending 23 schools in 1968, to New
York City, with more than one @@859@@ million students in 853 schools.
The sample includes districts in urban areas of all sizes, suburbs (\\e.
g.,\\ Arlington County, Virginia) and rural areas (\\e. g.,\\ Jefferson
Parish, Louisiana, and Raleigh County, West Virginia). It contains 34
countywide districts with central cities (the 11 Florida districts fit
this description, plus Clark County, Nevada and others) and a small
number of consolidated districts (New Castle County, Delaware and
Jefferson County, Kentucky).

      “The districts also vary in their racial compositions and levels
of segregation. Initial plans were implemented in Mobile, Alabama and
Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, and in a number of other southern
districts in the face of total racial segregation. At the other extreme,
Santa Clara, California had a relatively even racial distribution prior
to its 1979 desegregation plan. When the 1965 plan was designed for
Harford County, Maryland, the district was 92 percent white. Compton,
California, on the other hand, became over 99 percent black in the
1980s, while Buffalo, New York had a virtual 50–50 split between white
and minority students prior to its 1977 plan.

      “It is not surprising to find a large number of different
desegregation strategies in a sample with this much variation.” Welch
23 (footnote omitted).

A majority of these desegregation techniques explicitly considered a
student’s race. See \\id.,\\ at 24–28. Transfer plans, for example,
allowed students to shift from a school in which they were in the racial
majority to a school in which they would be in a racial minority.
Some districts, such as Richmond, California, and Buffalo, New York,
permitted only “one-way” transfers, in which only black students
attending predominantly black schools were permitted to transfer to
designated receiver schools. \\Id.,\\ at 25. Fifty-three of the one
hundred twenty-five studied districts used transfers as a component of
their plans. \\Id.,\\ at 83–91. @@860@@

  At the state level, 46 States and Puerto Rico have adopted policies
that encourage or require local school districts to enact interdistrict
or intradistrict open choice plans. Eight of those States condition
approval of transfers to another school or district on whether the
transfer will produce increased racial integration. Eleven other States
require local boards to deny transfers that are not in compliance with
the local school board’s desegregation plans. See Education Commission
of the States, StateNotes, Open Enrollment: 50-State Report (2007),
online at http://mb2.ecs.org/ reports/Report.aspx?id=268.

  Arkansas, for example, provides by statute that “[n]o student may
transfer to a nonresident district where the percentage of enrollment
for the student’s race exceeds that percentage in the student’s
resident district.” Ark. Code Ann. §6–18–206(f)(1), as amended,
2007 Ark. Gen. Acts no. 552. An Ohio statute provides, in respect to
student choice, that each school district must establish “[p]rocedures
to ensure that an appropriate racial balance is maintained in the
district schools.” Ohio Rev. Code Ann. § 3313.98(B)(2)(b)(iii)
(Lexis Supp. 2006). Ohio adds that a “district may object to the
enrollment of a native student in an adjacent or other district in order
to maintain an appropriate racial balance.” § 3313.98(F)(1)(a).

  A Connecticut statute states that its student choice program will
seek to “preserve racial and ethnic balance.” Conn. Gen. Stat.
§ 10–266aa(b)(2) (2007). Connecticut law requires each school
district to submit racial group population figures to the State Board of
Education. § 10–226a. Another Connecticut regulation provides that
“[a]ny school in which the Proportion for the School falls outside of
a range from 25 percentage points less to 25 percentage points more than
the Comparable Proportion for the School District, shall be determined
to be racially imbalanced.” Conn. Agencies Regs. § 10–226e–3(b)
(1999). A “racial imbalance” determination requires the district to
submit a plan to correct the @@861@@ racial imbalance, which plan may
include “mandatory pupil reassignment.” §§ 10–226e–5(a) and
(c)(4).

  Interpreting that State’s Constitution, the Connecticut Supreme
Court has held legally inadequate the reliance by a local school
district solely upon some of the techniques <<Justice Kennedy>>
today recommends (\\e. g.,\\ reallocating resources, etc.). See
\\Sheff\\ v. \\O’Neill,\\ 238 Conn. 1, 678 A. 2d 1267 (1996). The
State Supreme Court wrote: “Despite the initiatives undertaken by
the defendants to alleviate the severe racial and ethnic disparities
among school districts, and despite the fact that the defendants did
not intend to create or maintain these disparities, the disparities
that continue to burden the education of the plaintiffs infringe upon
their fundamental state constitutional right to a substantially equal
educational opportunity.” \\Id.,\\ at 42, 678 A. 2d, at 1289.

  At a minimum, the plurality’s views would threaten a surge of
race-based litigation. Hundreds of state and federal statutes and
regulations use racial classifications for educational or other
purposes. See \\supra,\\ at 828–829. In many such instances, the
contentious force of legal challenges to these classifications,
meritorious or not, would displace earlier calm.

  The wide variety of different integration plans that school districts
use throughout the Nation suggests that the problem of racial
segregation in schools, including \\de facto\\ segregation, is difficult
to solve. The fact that many such plans have used explicitly racial
criteria suggests that such criteria have an important, sometimes
necessary, role to play. The fact that the controlling opinion would
make a school district’s use of such criteria often unlawful (and the
plurality’s “colorblind” view would make such use always unlawful)
suggests that today’s opinion will require setting aside the laws of
several States and many local communities.

  As I have pointed out, \\supra,\\ at 805–806, \\de facto\\
resegregation is on the rise. See Appendix A, \\infra.\\ It is
reason@@862@@able to conclude that such resegregation can create serious
educational, social, and civic problems. See \\supra,\\ at 839– 845.
Given the conditions in which school boards work to set policy, see
\\supra,\\ at 822, they may need all of the means presently at their
disposal to combat those problems. Yet the plurality would deprive
them of at least one tool that some districts now consider vital—the
limited use of broad race-conscious student population ranges.

  I use the words “may need” here deliberately. The plurality, or
at least those who follow <<Justice Thomas>>’ “ ‘colorblind’
” approach, see \\ante,\\ at 772–773 (concurring opinion);
\\Grutter,\\ 539 U. S., at 353–354 (<<Thomas,>> J., concurring in
part and dissenting in part), may feel confident that, to end invidious
discrimination, one must end \\all\\ governmental use of race-conscious
criteria including those with inclusive objectives. See \\ante,\\
at 747–748 (plurality opinion); see also \\ante,\\ at 772–773
(<<Thomas,>> J., concurring). By way of contrast, I do not claim to know
how best to stop harmful discrimination; how best to create a society
that includes all Americans; how best to overcome our serious problems
of increasing \\defacto\\ segregation, troubled inner-city schooling,
and poverty correlated with race. But, as a judge, I do know that the
Constitution does not authorize judges to dictate solutions to these
problems. Rather, the Constitution creates a democratic political system
through which the people themselves must together find answers. And it
is for them to debate how best to educate the Nation’s children and
how best to administer America’s schools to achieve that aim. The
Court should leave them to their work. And it is for them to decide,
to quote the plurality’s slogan, whether the best “way to stop
discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the
basis of race.” \\Ante,\\ at 748. See also \\Parents Involved VII,\\
426 F. 3d, at 1222 (Bea, J., dissenting) (“The way to end racial
discrimination is to stop discriminating by race”). That is why the
Equal Protection Clause out@@863@@laws invidious discrimination, but
does not similarly forbid all use of race-conscious criteria.

  Until today, this Court understood the Constitution as affording the
people, acting through their elected representatives, freedom to select
the use of “race-conscious” criteria from among their available
options. See \\Adarand,\\ 515 U. S., at 237 (“[S]trict scrutiny” in
this context is “[not] ‘strict in theory, but fatal in fact’ ”
(quoting \\Fullilove,\\ 448 U. S., at 519 (Marshall, J., concurring in
judgment))). Today, however, the Court restricts (and some Members would
eliminate) that leeway. I fear the consequences of doing so for the law,
for the schools, for the democratic process, and for America’s efforts
to create, out of its diversity, one Nation.

# VI \\Conclusions\\

  To show that the school assignment plans here meet the requirements
of the Constitution, I have written at exceptional length. But that
length is necessary. I cannot refer to the history of the plans in these
cases to justify the use of race-conscious criteria without describing
that history in full. I cannot rely upon \\Swann\\’s statement that
the use of race-conscious limits is permissible without showing, rather
than simply asserting, that the statement represents a constitutional
principle firmly rooted in federal and state law. Nor can I explain my
disagreement with the Court’s holding and the plurality’s opinion
without offering a detailed account of the arguments they propound and
the consequences they risk.

  Thus, the opinion’s reasoning is long. But its conclusion is short:
The plans before us satisfy the requirements of the Equal Protection
Clause. And it is the plurality’s opinion, not this dissent, that
“fails to ground the result it would reach in law.” \\Ante,\\ at
735.

  Four basic considerations have led me to this view. \\First,\\ the
histories of Louisville and Seattle reveal complex circum@@864@@stances
and a long tradition of conscientious efforts by local school boards
to resist racial segregation in public schools. Segregation at the
time of \\Brown\\ gave way to expansive remedies that included busing,
which in turn gave rise to fears of white flight and resegregation. For
decades now, these school boards have considered and adopted and revised
assignment plans that sought to rely less upon race, to emphasize
greater student choice, and to improve the conditions of all schools for
all students, no matter the color of their skin, no matter where they
happen to reside. The plans under review—which are less burdensome,
more egalitarian, and more effective than prior plans—continue
in that tradition. And their history reveals school district goals
whose remedial, educational, and democratic elements are inextricably
intertwined each with the others. See Part I, \\supra,\\ at 804–823.

  \\Second,\\ since this Court’s decision in \\Brown,\\ the law
has consistently and unequivocally approved of both voluntary and
compulsory race-conscious measures to combat segregated schools. The
Equal Protection Clause, ratified following the Civil War, has always
distinguished in practice between state action that excludes and thereby
subordinates racial minorities and state action that seeks to bring
together people of all races. From \\Swann\\ to \\Grutter,\\ this
Court’s decisions have emphasized this distinction, recognizing that
the fate of race relations in this country depends upon unity among our
children, “for unless our children begin to learn together, there
is little hope that our people will ever learn to live together.”
\\Milliken,\\ 418 U. S., at 783 (Marshall, J., dissenting). See also
Sumner, Equality Before the Law: Unconstitutionality of Separate Colored
Schools in Massachusetts (Dec. 4, 1849), in 2 The Works of Charles
Sumner 327, 371 (1870) (“The law contemplates not only that all shall
be taught, but that \\all\\ shall be taught \\together\\”). See Part
II, \\supra,\\ at 823–837. @@865@@

  \\Third,\\ the plans before us, subjected to rigorous judicial review,
are supported by compelling state interests and are narrowly tailored to
accomplish those goals. Just as diversity in higher education was deemed
compelling in \\Grutter,\\ diversity in public primary and secondary
schools—where there is even more to gain—must be, \\a fortiori,\\ a
compelling state interest. Even apart from \\Grutter,\\ five Members of
this Court agree that “avoiding racial isolation” and “achiev[ing]
a diverse student population” remain today compelling interests.
\\Ante,\\ at 797–798 (opinion of <<Kennedy,>> J.). These interests
combine remedial, educational, and democratic objectives. For the
reasons discussed above, however, I disagree with <<Justice Kennedy>>
that Seattle and Louisville have not done enough to demonstrate that
their present plans are necessary to continue upon the path set by
\\Brown.\\ These plans are \\more\\ “narrowly tailored” than the
race-conscious law school admissions criteria at issue in \\Grutter.\\
Hence, their lawfulness follows \\a fortiori\\ from this Court’s prior
decisions. See Parts III–IV, \\supra,\\ at 838–858.

  \\Fourth,\\ the plurality’s approach risks serious harm to the law
and for the Nation. Its view of the law rests either upon a denial of
the distinction between exclusionary and inclusive use of race-conscious
criteria in the context of the Equal Protection Clause, or upon such a
rigid application of its “test” that the distinction loses practical
significance. Consequently, the Court’s decision today slows down
and sets back the work of local school boards to bring about racially
diverse schools. See Part V, \\supra,\\ at 858–863.

  Indeed, the consequences of the approach the Court takes today are
serious. Yesterday, the plans under review were lawful. Today, they are
not. Yesterday, the citizens of this Nation could look for guidance to
this Court’s unanimous pronouncements concerning desegregation. Today,
they cannot. Yesterday, school boards had available to them a @@866@@
full range of means to combat segregated schools. Today, they do not.

  The Court’s decision undermines other basic institutional principles
as well. What has happened to \\stare decisis?\\ The history of the
plans before us, their educational importance, their highly limited
use of race—all these and more— make clear that the compelling
interest here is stronger than in \\Grutter.\\ The plans here are more
narrowly tailored than the law school admissions program there at issue.
Hence, applying \\Grutter\\’s strict test, their lawfulness follows
\\a fortiori.\\ To hold to the contrary is to transform that test
from “strict” to “fatal in fact”—the very opposite of what
\\Grutter\\ said. And what has happened to \\Swann?\\ To \\Mc-Daniel?\\
To \\Crawford?\\ To \\Harris?\\ To \\School Committee of Boston?\\ To
\\Seattle School Dist. No. 1?\\ After decades of vibrant life, they
would all, under the plurality’s logic, be written out of the law.

  And what of respect for democratic local decisionmaking by States and
school boards? For several decades this Court has rested its public
school decisions upon \\Swann\\’s basic view that the Constitution
grants local school districts a significant degree of leeway where the
inclusive use of race-conscious criteria is at issue. Now localities
will have to cope with the difficult problems they face (including
resegregation) deprived of one means they may find necessary.

  And what of law’s concern to diminish and peacefully settle conflict
among the Nation’s people? Instead of accommodating different
good-faith visions of our country and our Constitution, today’s
holding upsets settled expectations, creates legal uncertainty, and
threatens to produce considerable further litigation, aggravating
race-related conflict.

  And what of the long history and moral vision that the Fourteenth
Amendment itself embodies? The plurality cites in support those who
argued in \\Brown\\ against segregation, and <<Justice Thomas>> likens
the approach that I have taken to that of segregation’s defenders.
See \\ante,\\ at 746– @@867@@ 748 (plurality opinion) (comparing Jim
Crow segregation to Seattle and Louisville’s integration polices);
\\ante,\\ at 773–782 (<<Thomas,>> J., concurring). But segregation
policies did not simply tell schoolchildren “where they could and
could not go to school based on the color of their skin,” \\ante,\\
at 747 (plurality opinion); they perpetuated a caste system rooted in
the institutions of slavery and 80 years of legalized subordination.
The lesson of history, see \\ante,\\ at 746–748 (same), is not
that efforts to continue racial segregation are constitutionally
indistinguishable from efforts to achieve racial integration. Indeed,
it is a cruel distortion of history to compare Topeka, Kansas, in the
1950’s to Louisville and Seattle in the modern day—to equate the
plight of Linda Brown (who was ordered to attend a Jim Crow school)
to the circumstances of Joshua McDonald (whose request to transfer to
a school closer to home was initially declined). This is not to deny
that there is a cost in applying “a state-mandated racial label.”
\\Ante,\\ at 797 (<<Kennedy,>> J., concurring in part and concurring in
judgment). But that cost does not approach, in degree or in kind, the
terrible harms of slavery, the resulting caste system, and 80 years of
legal racial segregation.

* * *

  Finally, what of the hope and promise of \\Brown?\\ For much of this
Nation’s history, the races remained divided. It was not long ago
that people of different races drank from separate fountains, rode on
separate buses, and studied in separate schools. In this Court’s
finest hour, \\Brown\\ v. \\Board of Education\\ challenged this history
and helped to change it. For \\Brown\\ held out a promise. It was a
promise embodied in three Amendments designed to make citizens of
slaves. It was the promise of true racial equality—not as a matter of
fine words on paper, but as a matter of everyday life in the Nation’s
cities and schools. It was about the nature of a democracy that must
work for all Americans. It @@868@@ sought one law, one Nation, one
people, not simply as a matter of legal principle but in terms of how we
actually live.

  Not everyone welcomed this Court’s decision in \\Brown.\\ Three
years after that decision was handed down, the Governor of Arkansas
ordered state militia to block the doors of a white schoolhouse so that
black children could not enter. The President of the United States
dispatched the 101st Airborne Division to Little Rock, Arkansas, and
federal troops were needed to enforce a desegregation decree. See
\\Cooper\\ v. \\Aaron,\\ 358 U. S. 1 (1958). Today, almost 50 years
later, attitudes toward race in this Nation have changed dramatically.
Many parents, white and black alike, want their children to attend
schools with children of different races. Indeed, the very school
districts that once spurned integration now strive for it. The long
history of their efforts reveals the complexities and difficulties they
have faced. And in light of those challenges, they have asked us not
to take from their hands the instruments they have used to rid their
schools of racial segregation, instruments that they believe are needed
to overcome the problems of cities divided by race and poverty. The
plurality would decline their modest request.

  The plurality is wrong to do so. The last half century has witnessed
great strides toward racial equality, but we have not yet realized
the promise of \\Brown.\\ To invalidate the plans under review is to
threaten the promise of \\Brown.\\ The plurality’s position, I fear,
would break that promise. This is a decision that the Court and the
Nation will come to regret.

  I must dissent. @@869@@
