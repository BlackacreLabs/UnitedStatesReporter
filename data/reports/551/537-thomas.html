<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Justice Thomas,</span> with whom <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Justice Scalia</span> joins, concurring. </p>

<p>The Court correctly concludes that <em>Bivens</em> v. <em>Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents,</em> 403 U.&nbsp;S. 388 (1971), does not supply a cause of action in this case. I therefore join its opinion. I write separately because I would not extend <em>Bivens</em> even if its reasoning logically applied to this case. “\\Bivens</em> is a relic of the heady days in which this Court assumed common-law powers to create causes of action.” <em>Correctional Services Corp.</em> v. <em>Malesko,</em> 534 U.&nbsp;S. 61, 75 (2001) (<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Scalia,</span> J., joined by T<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">homas,</span> J., concurring). Accordingly, in my view, <em>Bivens</em> and its progeny should be limited “to the precise circumstances that they involved.” <em>Malesko, supra,</em> at 75.</p>
