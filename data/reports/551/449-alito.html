<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Justice Alito,</span> concurring.</p>

<p>I join the principal opinion because I conclude (1) that §&nbsp;203 of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002, 2 U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §&nbsp;441b(b)(2) (2000 ed., Supp. IV), as applied, cannot constitutionally ban any advertisement that may reasonably be interpreted as anything other than an appeal to vote for or against a candidate, (2) that the ads at issue here may reasonably be interpreted as something other than such an appeal, and (3) that because §&nbsp;203 is unconstitutional as applied to the advertisements before us, it is unnecessary to go further and decide whether §&nbsp;203 is unconstitutional on its face. If it turns out that the implementation of the as-applied standard set out in the principal opinion impermissibly chills political speech, see <em>post,</em> at 496–497 (<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Scalia,</span> J., joined by <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Kennedy</span> and <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Thomas,</span> JJ., concurring in part and concur<span class="break">483</span>ring in judgment), we will presumably be asked in a future case to reconsider the holding in <em>McConnell</em> v. <em>Federal Election Comm’n,</em> 540 U.&nbsp;S. 93 (2003), that §&nbsp;203 is facially constitutional.</p>
