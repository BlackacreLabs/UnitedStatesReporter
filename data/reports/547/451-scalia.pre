  <<Justice Scalia,>> concurring.

  I join the opinion of the Court. I also note that it is inconceivable
that the injury alleged in the 18 U. S. C. § 1962(c) claim at issue
here is within the zone of interests protected by the RICO cause of
action for fraud perpetrated upon New York State. See \\Holmes\\ v.
\\Securities Investor Protection\\ \\Corporation,\\ 503 U. S. 258,
286–290 (1992) (<<Scalia,>> J., concurring in judgment). @@463@@
