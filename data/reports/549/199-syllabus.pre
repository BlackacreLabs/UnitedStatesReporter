The Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PLRA), in order to address the
large number of prisoner complaints filed in federal court, mandates
early judicial screening of prisoner complaints and requires prisoners
to exhaust prison grievance procedures before filing suit. 42 U. S. C.
§ 1997e(a). Petitioners, inmates in Michigan prisons, filed grievances
using the Michigan Department of Corrections (MDOC) grievance process.
After unsuccessfully seeking redress through that process, petitioner
Jones filed a § 1983 suit against six prison officials. The District
Court dismissed on the merits as to four of them and as to two others
found that Jones had failed to adequately plead exhaustion in his
complaint. Petitioner Williams also filed a § 1983 suit after his
two MDOC grievances were denied. The District Court found that he had
not exhausted his administrative remedies with regard to one of the
grievances because he had not identified any of the respondents named
in the lawsuit during the grievance process. While the court found
Williams’s other claim properly exhausted, it dismissed the entire
suit under the Sixth Circuit’s total exhaustion rule for PLRA cases.
Petitioner Walton’s § 1983 lawsuit also was dismissed under the
total exhaustion rule because his MDOC grievance named only one of
the six defendants in his lawsuit. The Sixth Circuit affirmed in each
case, relying on its procedural rules that require a prisoner to allege
and demonstrate exhaustion in his complaint, permit suit only against
defendants identified in the prisoner’s grievance, and require courts
to dismiss the entire action if the prisoner fails to satisfy the
exhaustion requirement as to any single claim in his complaint.

\\Held:\\ The Sixth Circuit’s rules are not required by the PLRA,
and crafting and imposing such rules exceeds the proper limits of the
judicial role. Pp. 211–224.

(a) Failure to exhaust is an affirmative defense under the PLRA, and
inmates are not required to specially plead or demonstrate exhaustion
in their complaints. There is no question that exhaustion is mandatory
@@200@@ under the PLRA, \\Porter\\ v. \\Nussle,\\ 534 U. S. 516, 524,
but it is less clear whether the prisoner must plead and demonstrate
exhaustion in the complaint or the defendant must raise lack of
exhaustion as an affirmative defense. Failure to exhaust is better
viewed as an affirmative defense. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)
requires simply a “short and plain statement of the claim” in a
complaint, and PLRA claims are typically brought under 42 U. S. C.
§ 1983, which does not require exhaustion at all. The fact that the
PLRA dealt extensively with exhaustion, but is silent on the issue
whether exhaustion must be pleaded or is an affirmative defense,
is strong evidence that the usual practice should be followed, and
the practice under the Federal Rules is to regard exhaustion as
an affirmative defense, including in the similar statutory scheme
governing habeas corpus, \\Day\\ v. \\McDonough,\\ 547 U. S. 198,
208. Courts should generally not depart from the Federal Rules’
usual practice based on perceived policy concerns. See, \\e. g.,
Leatherman\\ v. \\Tarrant County Narcotics Intelligence and Coordination
Unit,\\ 507 U. S. 163. Those courts that require prisoners to plead
and demonstrate exhaustion contend that prisoner complaints must be
treated outside of the typical framework if the PLRA’s screening
requirement is to function effectively. But the screening requirement
does not—explicitly or implicitly—justify deviating from the usual
procedural practice beyond the departures specified by the PLRA itself.
Although exhaustion was a “centerpiece” of the PLRA, \\Woodford\\
v. \\Ngo,\\ 548 U. S. 81, 84, failure to exhaust was notably not added
in terms to the enumerated grounds justifying dismissal upon early
screening. Section 1997e(g)—which allows defendants to waive their
right to reply to a prisoner complaint without being deemed to have
admitted the complaint’s allegations—shows that when Congress meant
to depart from the usual procedural requirements, it did so expressly.
Given that the PLRA does not itself require plaintiffs to plead
exhaustion, such a result “must be obtained by. . . amending the Federal
Rules, and not by judicial interpretation.” \\Leatherman, supra,\\ at
168. Pp. 211–217.

(b) Exhaustion is not \\per se\\ inadequate under the PLRA when an
individual later sued was not named in the grievance. Nothing in the
MDOC policy supports the conclusion that the grievance process was
improperly invoked because an individual later named as a defendant was
not named at the first step of the process; at the time each grievance
was filed here, the MDOC policy did not specifically require a prisoner
to name anyone in the grievance. Nor does the PLRA impose such a
requirement. The “applicable procedural rules” that a prisoner
must properly exhaust, \\Woodford, supra,\\ at 88, are defined not by
the PLRA, but by the prison grievance process itself. As the MDOC’s
pro@@201@@cedures make no mention of naming particular officials, the
Sixth Circuit’s rule imposing such a prerequisite to proper exhaustion
is unwarranted. The Circuit’s rule may promote early notice to those
who might later be sued, but that has not been thought to be one of
the leading purposes of the exhaustion requirement. The court below
should determine in the first instance whether petitioners’ grievances
otherwise satisfied the exhaustion requirement. Pp. 217–219.

(c) The PLRA does not require dismissal of the entire complaint when a
prisoner has failed to exhaust some, but not all, of the claims included
in the complaint. Respondents argue that had Congress intended courts
to dismiss only unexhausted claims while retaining the balance of the
lawsuit, it would have used the word “claim” instead of “action”
in § 1997e(a), which provides that “[n]o action shall be brought”
unless administrative procedures are exhausted. That boilerplate
language is used in many instances in the Federal Code, and statutory
references to an “action” have not typically been read to mean that
every claim included in the action must meet the pertinent requirement
before the “action” may proceed. If a complaint contains both good
and bad claims, the court proceeds with the good and leaves the bad.
Respondents note that the total exhaustion requirement in habeas corpus
is an exception to this general rule, but a court presented with a
mixed habeas petition typically “allow[s] the petitioner to delete
the unexhausted claims and to proceed with the exhausted claims,”
\\Rhines\\ v. \\Weber,\\ 544 U. S. 269, 278, which is the opposite
of the rule the Sixth Circuit adopted, and precisely the rule that
respondents argue against. Although other PLRA sections distinguish
between actions and claims, respondents’ reading of § 1997e(a)
creates its own inconsistencies, and their policy arguments are also
unpersuasive. Pp. 219–224.
