Plaintiffs below, Arizona residents, Indian tribes, and community groups, brought suit in federal court challenging the State’s new voter identification requirements. The District Court denied their request for a preliminary injunction but issued no findings of fact or conclusions of law at that time. When, on appeal, plaintiffs received a briefing schedule concluding after the November election, they sought an injunction pending appeal, which the Ninth Circuit granted without explanation. Subsequently, the District Court issued its findings of fact and conclusions of law.

\\Held\\: There is no indication that the Ninth Circuit gave the necessary deference to the discretion of the District Court, and this was error. By failing to provide any factual findings or reasoning of its own, the Ninth Circuit left this Court in the position of evaluating the Circuit’s bare order in light of the District Court’s ultimate findings, which have not been shown to be incorrect. While this Court expresses no opinion on the correct disposition of the appeals or ultimate resolution of the cases, vacating the Ninth Circuit’s order shall of necessity allow the election to proceed without an injunction suspending the requirements.

Certiorari granted; vacated and remanded. @@2@@
